 Teaching remotely - Coronavirus outbreak
##########################################

.. warning:: Information on the Coronavirus Epidemic (in France)

    Go read *regularly* the `<https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus>`_ page of the French government, as well as your own government.
    And reading a local newspaper (e.g. in France: `<https://www.lemonde>`_) is also a very good idea!


You can have fun for 3 minutes and listen to this nice song, by *Foil Arms and Hog*, my favorite English humor band:

In French, this song is quite funny as well:

Working from home because of the Coronavirus outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------

As of Friday 13rd of March 2020, my colleagues and I at ENS de Rennes were asked to start working from home.

**Update** : since we started working at the end of August 2020, everything so far has been in presence, as usual.

**Update** : since end of October 2020, everything so far has been in fully remote.

**Update** : since January 2021, everything so far has been in fully remote, except at most one day a week (or two half-days).

.. warning:: This page is only describing MY point-of-view, it is NOT officially from the point of view of my employer.

.. todo:: Translate this page from French to English here?

I am describing **in French** in `this webpage <coronavirus.fr.html>`_ how I will (try my best) to teach remotely, during this special moment !
