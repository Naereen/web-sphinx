 Teaching remotely - Coronavirus outbreak
##########################################

.. warning:: Information on the Coronavirus Epidemic (in France)

   Go read *regularly* the `<https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus>`_ page of the French government, as well as your own government.
   And reading a local newspaper (e.g. in France: `<https://www.lemonde>`_) is also a very good idea!

*TL;DR*: *Basic advices*: **in a situation like this pandemic and COVID crisis, even more than usual, we all have to be exemplary citizens**. Be smart, be nice, be good. We all have to be careful and cautious, about our own health and the health of everybody else, but no only the physical health but also the well being and psychologic health. Work seriously and well, while taking care of yourself and your closed ones (friends, family, colleagues, comrades, neighbors, etc.). Maintain a good rhythm for your daily life (sleep, alimentation, sport, and reasonable usage and time of numerical entertainment and work), and don't be afraid to be extra helpful, especially  towards the more fragile and older people.

Here are some details and tips, before I talk more in depth about how the COVID and coronavirus crisis has influenced `my teaching activities <teaching.en.html>`_ below:

.. todo:: Translate these lines in English too!

- Friends or foes, colleagues or students, if you want to or need to contact me, write me at ``lilian.besson`` at ``crans.org``, or `my French phone number <_images/.telephone.png>`_. More ways of contacting me are listed here: `<callme.en.html>`_!

- If you feel lonely, we can call each other (with `Jitsi <jitsi.en.html>`_ in video-call)! I like board games and free and open-source software (FOSS), so we can play a game of Pictionnary, with `Tableaunoir <https://tableaunoir.github.io/>`_ to draw and `this random Pictionnary word generator I wrote <https://naereen.github.io/Free-dictionnaries-for-Pictionnary/index.html>`_ ? We can also play `via BoardGameAre.net <https://boardgamearena.com/player?id=88972705>`_?

- *Do you feel bored?* I give cultural ideas, of books, movies, TV shows and more, on `my top 10 <top10.en.html>`_, and for YouTube videos and channels on `my page about what I watch/listen on YouTube <what-i-watch-on-youtube.en.html>`_!
- Feeling like playing video-game together? I don't play desktop/PC games, but we can play PokÃ©mon! I want to continue my fun collaborative project of last year 2020, `with Pokemon Gold or Silver <https://pokemon-via-github-contre-covid-2020-fr.github.io/>`_ (or other games), `contact me <callme.en.html>`_ !
- I give some tips to enjoy your video-calls on `<conseils-visio.en.html>`_ (and tips for emails at `<conseils-email.en.html>`_)!

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ In English, you can have fun for 3 minutes and listen to this nice song, by *Foil Arms and Hog*, my favorite English humor trio (2021-04-09)! I also give `some jokes in English on this page <jokes.en.html>`_.

.. youtube:: iiEP6UZ8X_4

- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· In French, this song is quite funny as well, to learn about the anti-COVID gestures that we can all apply to save lives! Je donne aussi des `blagues en franÃ§ais sur cette page <blagues.en.html>`_.

Working from home because of the Coronavirus outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------

As of Friday 13rd of March 2020, my colleagues and I at ENS de Rennes were asked to start working from home.

**Update** : since we started working at the end of August 2020, everything so far has been in presence, as usual.

**Update** : since end of October 2020, everything so far has been in fully remote.

**Update** : since January 2021, everything so far has been in fully remote, except at most one day a week (or two half-days).

.. warning:: This page is only describing MY point-of-view, it is NOT officially from the point of view of my employer.

.. todo:: Translate this page from French to English here?

I am describing **in French** in `this webpage <coronavirus.en.html>`_ how I will (try my best) to teach remotely, during this special moment !
