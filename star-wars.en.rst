This page is about `Star Wars <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars>`_.

.. note:: Let's start by quoting Wikip√©dia:

    Star Wars is an American epic space-opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. The franchise holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise". In 2020, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.

    The original film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Together, the three trilogies form what has been referred to as the "Skywalker saga". All nine films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful. Together with the theatrical spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise.

The order in which I advise watching Star Wars

The order in which I recommend watching Star Wars is as follows:

1. *A Star Wars story: Rogue One* (2016): This very good movie, with no Jedis or Sith and no main heroes, is the best way to enter the Star Wars universe, and makes a perfect transition to the next movie;
2. *Star Wars 4 : A New Hope* (1977) in its entirety ;

...note: Why watch SW 1 and 2 and the *Clone Wars* series now? To consider them as flashbacks, corresponding to what Obi Wan Kenobi would have told Luke ;

3. *Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace* (1999) in full;
4. *Star Wars 2: The Clone Wars* (2002). I recommend ignoring the fight scene with all the Jedis in the stadium (absurd scene).
5. *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* the entire TV series;

6. *Star Wars 5: Empire Strikes Back* (1981);

...note: Why watch SW 3 and the series Rebels now? Like flashbacks, consistent with what Yoda would have told Luke, and Luke's research in the Rebel Alliance archives;

7. *Star Wars 3: Revenge of the Sith* (2005)
8. *Star Wars 6: The Return of the Jedi (1983) ;
9. *A Star Wars story: Solo* (2018): Like a flashback of Han Solo (last flashback);

10. *Star Wars 7: The Force Awakens* (2015)
11. *Star Wars: Rebels* in its entirety, watch it now because Luke looked up files involving Darth Vader and the last Jedis before trying to recreate the Jedi order, and because he's telling Rey about all the stories happening in this TV show;
12. *Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi* (2017);
13. *Star Wars 9: Skywalker's Ascension* (2019).
