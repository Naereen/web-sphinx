A few words about me
--------------------

|Greetings|, and welcome to my website!
I am **Lilian Besson**, teacher-developper in Computer Science, and I was an assistant professor at |ENSRennes| from 2019 to 2021.
I am now a full-time professor of Computer Science in `Classes Préparatoires <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_pr%C3%A9paratoires_scientifiques>`_, in charge of the `MP2I <https://prepas.org/index.php?article=42>`_ class at `Lycée Kléber <https://lycee-kleber.com.fr/cpge-scientifiques/>`_, in `Strasbourg <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg>`_ in France.

Before occupying these teaching-focused positions, I `pursued my PhD in Telecommunications and Machine Learning <phd/>`_ in CentraleSupélec in Rennes and Inria in Lille, and I `graduated <http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/haut-de-page/annuaire/besson-lilian-128754.kjsp>`_ in Mathematics and Computer Science at |ENSCachan|, with a `Master degree <publis/mva-2016/>`_ in Machine Learning, and a Master degree in teaching Mathematics (along with « agrégation », the French national exam to become a civil servant teacher).

- From August 2019 to August 2021, I was a `junior professor (agrégé) <http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/lilian-besson--292020.kjsp>`_ at `ENS Rennes <http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/>`_, in charge of the class preparing the "agrégation" national exam, with a major in mathematics and a minor in computer science, level M2, and in charge of lectures for `introduction and advanced algorithms <https://perso.crans.org/besson/info1_algo1_2019/>`_, and `other teaching activities <teaching.en.html>`_.

- In February 2021, I had fun adding these applications there on my site, to be able to write small codes, give quick explanations without having to install anything on his computer: `ocaml.besson.link <http://ocaml.besson.link>`_ for OCaml 4.12, `jscpp.besson.link <http://jscpp.besson.link>`_ for C/C++, `python.besson.link <http://python.besson.link>`_  and `notebook.besson.link <http://notebook.besson.link>`_ for Python 3.8, `turing.besson.link <http://turing.besson.link>`_ for Turing machines, and `tableaunoir.besson.link <http://tableaunoir.besson.link>`_ for an interactive and super functional blackboard! Note: I did not develop these applications myself, they are all free under the MIT or GPLv3 license.

- I was also an associate researcher with the `PANAMA team <https://team.inria.fr/panama/>`_ at IRISA in Rennes. My research interests were on innovative technologies for modern teaching, Python and OCaml programming, machine learning in general, and other directions.


Between September 2016 and August 2019:

- I was pursuing `my PhD <phd/>`_ at CentraleSupélec (`SCEE team <http://www-scee.rennes.supelec.fr/wp/>`_, `IETR lab <https://www.ietr.fr/spip.php?auteur1069>`_) in Rennes (France), with `Christophe Moy <http://www.rennes.supelec.fr/ren/perso/cmoy/recherche.php>`_ and `Emilie Kaufmann <http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/research.html>`_ (`SequeL team, CRIStAL lab, at Lille <https://team.inria.fr/sequel/team-members/>`_). My PhD was on multi-players multi-arms bandits models applied to radio-telecommunication, especially I-o-T problems. I now hold a PhD in telecommunications. My PhD `thesis is here <https://perso.crans.org/besson/articles/PhD_thesis__Lilian_Besson.pdf>`_ and the slides used for my defense are `there <https://perso.crans.org/besson/slides/2019_11__PhD_Defense__Multi-players_Bandit_Algorithms_for_Internet_of_Things_Networks/slides.pdf>`_.
- And I was `teaching <teaching.en.html>`_ theoretical computer science at `ENS Rennes <http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/agregation-option-d/>`_ (for a class preparing for the agregation national exam, level M2) and `ENSAI <http://www.ensai.fr/formation/id-1re-annee.html>`_ (complexity and calculabilty, level L3), thanks to `this mission <http://www.irisa.fr/fr/emplois/enseignants/missions-denseignement-au-departement-informatique-lens-rennes>`_.

The last three years (2016-19)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* I was doing my PhD. Please `read this page <https://perso.crans.org/besson/me/index.en.html>`_ to learn more! I now hold a PhD in telecommunications. My PhD `thesis is here <https://perso.crans.org/besson/articles/PhD_thesis__Lilian_Besson.pdf>`_ and the slides used for my defense are `there <https://perso.crans.org/besson/slides/2019_11__PhD_Defense__Multi-players_Bandit_Algorithms_for_Internet_of_Things_Networks/slides.pdf>`_.

In *2015-16*
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* I was a research intern in the `BIG/LIB team <http://bigwww.epfl.ch/people.html>`_ at `EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) <http://www.epfl.ch/>`_, from April to August 2016, under the supervision of `Julien Fageot <http://bigwww.epfl.ch/fageot/index.html>`_ and `Michael Unser <http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/>`_. Check out the `git repository for my internship <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/internship-mva-2016>`_ (`my Master thesis <https://goo.gl/xPzw4A>`_ is finished) !

* I obtained the `MVA master program <http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/academics/mva-master-degree-227777.kjsp>`_ (at `ENS de Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/>`_, now ENS de Paris-Saclay), in applied Maths, mainly in `machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_ and `numerical optimization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization>`_. Cf. `my documents written for the MVA <./publis/mva-2016/>`_, and `6 projects <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/profile/repositories?search=MVA>`_: `PCS <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/pcs2016>`_, `PGM <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/pgm2016>`_, `RL / GML <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/gml2016>`_, `Kernel <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/kernel2016>`_, `Brain Imaging <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/brain2016>`_, `Neuro-Sciences <http://lbesson.bitbucket.io/neuro2016>`_. I ranked *first* for the MVA master in 2015-16, with 13 courses valided and the final grade of **18.43 / 20** (`"summa cum laude" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_honors>`_).

* I was also `teaching in Maths. <teaching.en.html>`_ and `in Computer Science <infoMP/>`_ in a prep' school for national competitive exams for French Engineering Schools (*"Grandes Écoles"*), at `"Lycée Lakanal" <http://www.lyc-lakanal-sceaux.ac-versailles.fr/>`_ in Sceaux (near Paris).


Studies and past jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* From mid-July 2014 to mid-May 2015, I **lived and worked in India**, `on the campus <https://goo.gl/maps/CcL2c>`_ of the new `Mahindra École Centrale <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/>`_ (a new *Engineering College* born from a partnership between the `(Indian) Mahindra group <http://www.mahindra.com/>`_ and `(French) École Centrale de Paris <http://www.ecp.fr/>`_).
  I was the first French faculty to work there full-time, and `I have been involved as a teaching assistant <http://web.archive.org/web/20150314101201/http://mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/faculty.php?fid=26>`_, in charge of mathematics (`MA101 <./ma101/>`_ and `MA102 <./ma102/>`_) `tutorials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorials#Tutorial_class>`_, and in charge of the `Computer Science CS101 course <./cs101/>`_ for the second semester!

* In 2013/2014, I `prepared and obtained <http://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/node/6477>`_ the (French) `agregation of Mathematics <http://agreg.org/>`_ exam
  (national competitive exam for "*Prep Schools*" teacher recruitment, with a major in Maths and a minor in Computer Science). `I have been ranked 23rd  <http://web.archive.org/web/20140709144720/agreg.org/ResultatsMerite2014.html>`_, for 275 available positions, for 795 candidates allowed to pass the oral exam (second step) in June and July 2014, and almost 1200 persons registered in October 2013. I also did the second year of my **Master of Science** in Fondamental **Mathematics** (major) and **Computer Science** (minor), with a `speciality on teaching <http://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/node/6477>`_. `A list of useful references (and other ressources) for this exam is here <agreg-2014/index>`_.

* In 2012/2013, I did the first year of the **MPRI** (`Master of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_science>`_ specialized in theoretical research in Computer Science, in Paris)
  and also the first year of the `Master of Science`_ in fondamental mathematics of ÉNS Cachan (again both `magna cum laude`_).

* From 2011/2012, I studied at `ÉNS Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/>`_, and in July 2012, I completed two `Bachelors of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_science>`_, one in **Mathematics** and one in **Computer Science**,
  both `magna cum laude <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magna_cum_laude>`_.

* During two years, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, I studied in Marseille, at `Lycée Thiers <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Thiers>`_, first in MPSI 2 and after in MP\*1.
