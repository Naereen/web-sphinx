Who am I?
---------
Hello, I am **Lilian Besson**, (former) `student at "ENS de Cachan" <http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/haut-de-page/annuaire/besson-lilian-128754.kjsp>`_, a *French* University specialized in training professors for superior studies, located near Paris.

Since mid-July 2014, I live in India, `on the campus <https://goo.gl/maps/CcL2c>`_ of the new `Mahindra École Centrale <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/contact.html>`_ (Engineering College born from a partnership between the `Mahindra group <http://www.mahindra.com/>`_ and `École Centrale de Paris <http://www.ecp.fr/>`_).
I am involved as an assistant professor, in charge of `mathematics <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/portal/course/info.php?id=7>`_ `tutorials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorials#Tutorial_class>`_ (and also in Computer Science for the second semester!).

Studies before 2014
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In 2013/2014, I prepared the (French) `agregation of Mathematics <http://agreg.org/>`_ exam
  (national competitive exam for "*Prep Schools*" teacher recruitment, with a major in Maths and a minor in Computer Science). `I have been ranked 23th  <http://web.archive.org/web/20140709144720/agreg.org/ResultatsMerite2014.html>`_, for 275 available positions, for 795 candidates allowed to pass the oral exam (second step) in June and July 2014, and almost 1100 persons registered in October 2013.

* In 2012/2013, I did the first year of the **MPRI** (`Master of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_science>`_ specialized in theoretical research in Computer Science, in Paris)
  and also the first year of the `Master of Science`_ in fondamental mathematics of ÉNS Cachan, again both `magna cum laude`_.

* From 2011/2012, I studied at `ÉNS Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/>`_, and in July 2012, I completed two `Bachelor of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_science>`_, one in **Mathematics** and one in **Computer Science**,
  both `magna cum laude <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magna_cum_laude>`_.

* During two years, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, I studied in Marseille, at `Lycée Thiers <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Thiers>`_, first in MPSI 2 and after in MP\*1.

* Before that, I lived in `Briançon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briançon>`_ (Hautes-Alpes, *France*), and I got my `scientific baccalauréat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at#S.C3.A9rie_scientifique_.28S.29>`_, with a major in maths and a minor in theater, in 2009.

   **A few words about me**:

   I like to walk, travel, go camping around France and Europe, mainly by using `hitchhiking <autostop.en>`_.
   I also like using new technologies, and enjoy design small games, or tiny pieces of software or web content
   for instance `nice javascript hacks <http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/README.html>`_, tutorials (on `ga-beacon <beacon.en.html>`_ or `Nano <NanoSyntax.html>`_)
   or Linux command line tools (`see this page for example <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin>`_).
   And apparently I cook pretty well, according to some, even if I miss cooking since I live in India...


   **A few words about this site**:

   I am working on this little website (currently, `<http://perso.crans.org/besson/>`_)
   when I have the time, hoping it can be useful to someone.
   :gray:`All the content of the website is (C) Lilian BESSON, and it is open source with the` `GPLv3 License <LICENSE.html>`_.
   `What means Open Source, explained with LEGO? <https://youtu.be/a8fHgx9mE5U>`_.
   This site's *Google Analytics* data suggest that some pages are indeed visited on a daily basis,
   so if you are here for something in particular, I hope you will not be disapointed
   (you can use `this bug tracker <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/issues/new>`_ to report any bug, or even to ask me anything).

Some of my profile pages on some great website:

  #. either with my *bitbucket* account `bitbucket.org/lbesson <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson>`_;
  #. or with my personal *Wikipedia* page `User:Naereen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Naereen>`_;
  #. or via my *Launchpad* profile `launchpad.net/~lbesson <https://launchpad.net/~lbesson>`_ (really unused);

MSc internship : "*Towards modularity for planning and robot programs verification*"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I did a research internship for the third semester of my Maths MSc and CS MSc from 03 June to 09 August 2013.

.. sidebar:: Résumé

   My *résumé* is available here `<cv.pdf>`_.
   It is realized with ``LaTeX``, and the package *moderncv*.


I worked at **UCL** (:under:`University College of London`),
under the direction of `Jules Villard <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Villard/>`_ (who quotes me `on his new page <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jvillar1/>`_, and `Peter O'Hearn <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/>`_,
about separation logic, planning in `AI`, and the study of *modularity* in those two domains.

My report (in English): `<rapportM1Info13.pdf>`_,
and my slides (in French): `<slidesM1Info13.pdf>`_.

:Mark: Jules gave me **19/20**. I got the mark **17.7/20** from the Computer Science jury at ENS Cachan, and **18.50/20** from the Maths jury at ENS Cachan.
