Inspirational people
--------------------

Here are a few lists of great scientist and persons that I consider to be very inspirational.

My 10 favorite historical figures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am a strong believer of the value of Pacifism, and I refuse to admire military figures or "great warriors", because as Yoda says in Star Wars, « Wars not make one great » (in *The Empire Strikes Back*).

- **King Arthur**, at least the version of Alexandre Astier in Kaamelott!
- **Gandhi** ;
- **Tenzin Gyatso**, the 14th Dalaï Lama ;
- **Martin Luther King** ;
- **Nelson Mandela** ;
- **Abbé Pierre** ;

.. todo:: Write this top10 !

My 10 favorite computer scientist in the 20th century
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Alan Turing**, for his machines and inspirational fight in the governments repression against non-heterosexual persons. I have taught different classes on computability and complexity since 2016, and used `Turing Machines <https://naereen.github.io/jsTuring_fr/turing.html>`_ a lot ;
- **Kurt Gödel**, for fondamental work on the foundations of computer science and mathematics. His incompleteness theorems that I studied in 2012 (during my Bachelor degree in Computer Science) are probably the theoretical results that most amazed me, ever ;
- **Grace Hopper**, very inspirational marine admiral and one of the most influential early software developer (first compiler) ;
- **Margaret Hamilton**, very inspirational lead developer of the team who wrote most of the code for the Apollo Mission in the 1960s ;
- **Donald Knuth**, legendary programmer and professor of computer scientist, mainly inspirational for his work on TeX and METAFONT and hiw awesome website ;
- **Guido van Rossum**, legendary programmer and creator of Python ;
- **Leslie Lamport**, legendary researcher of computer scientist, mainly inspirational for his work on LaTeX ;
- **Richard Stallman**, legendary programmer and creator of the GNU project, first and main programmer of GCC, GNU Make, GNU Emacs and many more important tools for open-source software and GNU/Linux systems. I met him in Rennes in 2017!
- **Tim Berners-Lee**, legendary figure of the early days of the Internet, less known for his current fights for a free and non-regulated Internet ;
- **Gordon Moore**, co-founder of Intel, and legendary figure of computer science and especially the development of personal computers. His famous "Moore's law" is the best example of a self-realizing prophecy: it was announced by the co-founder of the very company which worked to fulfil the prophecy, now true for more than 55 years.

My 10 favorite computer scientist of the 21st century

- `Richard Garfield <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield>`_ for the amazing game Magic of the Gathering (did you know he has a PhD in mathematics? he was the first PhD of maths that I knew of, when I was 11 and he was inspirational for many years!) ;

Computer programming and computer things
----------------------------------------

My other favorite things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order of preference (first means 😍) :

- **Operating Systems**: XUbuntu, Ubuntu, Fedora ;
- **Fonts**: I loved `FiraCode <https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>`_, which is awesome for developers but it was confusing for my teaching activities in 2019 so I stopped using it. Nowadays I use mainly `Fira Mono by Mozilla <https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/>`_, and Ubuntu Mono for monospace fonts (for code), and I love TeX Gyre Pagella (open-source alternative to Palatino (in LaTeX, ``\usepackage{tgpagella}`` is enough)
- **Text editors**: Visual Studio Code (see `this page <visualstudiocode.en.html>`_), Jupyter notebook, GNU Nano, Sublime Text 3, GNU Emacs (tuareg mode for OCaml).
- **Days of the year**: 31st of August (last day before new scholar year, and a good memory of a loved one), 21st of March (first day of spring, I love spring), 14th of March (Pi Day, and International Mathematician Day), 4th of May (`Star Wars <star-wars.en.html>`_ day!), 21st of June (longest day! victory of light over darkness!), 31st of October (not because of Halloween), 17th of February (birthday of my best friend, and many good memories), and not the 12th of January as I'm not especially a big fan of my own birthday.
- Other: see `my-favorite-tools.en.html>`_ for a detailed list of my favorite computer tools.

My 10 favorite languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Python** is without a doubt my favorite language.
   - I `wrote a lot of Python <https://naereen.github.io/#python>`_ since my first use of Python (2.7) in 2012, for `a multiplayer Bomberman game I wrote in 2012 <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/mpri-bomberman>`_ and `reinforcement learning on old Mario NES game in 2018 <https://github.com/Naereen/gym-nes-mario-bros/>`_, `hundreds <https://github.com/Naereen/FreeSMS.py/>`_ `of scripts <https://github.com/Naereen/bin/>`_ and static web-sites (`this one <https://github.com/Naereen/web-sphinx>`_, and `other blogs <https://github.com/Naereen/cuisine>`_) since 2012, for my PhD for `SMPyBandits <https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits>`_ and `other packages <https://naereen.github.io/#science>`_ `published on Pypi <https://pypi.org/user/Naereen/>`_ ;
   - I also wrote tiny `web apps using Flask <https://github.com/Naereen/GMusicBrowser-FullScreen-WebApp/>`_, worked on `designing my own hand-written font <https://github.com/Naereen/My-Own-HandWriting-Font/>`_, `using Fontify <https://github.com/Naereen/Fontify/>`_ in 2018, and in 2021 I did fun experiments like `can you program by just sending SMS messages? <https://github.com/Naereen/Peut-on-coder-avec-OCaml-Python-et-C-par-SMS/>`_
   - I also have tiny contributions to Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Jupyter and other awesome projects. I'm a huge fan of Jupyter and IPython since 2014, and contribute frequently to tiny extensions like `lolviz <https://github.com/parrt/lolviz/>`_ or `tutormagic <https://github.com/kikocorreoso/tutormagic/>`_.
   - I taught different couses in Python, starting with `CS101 in India in 2015 <https://perso.crans.org/besson/cs101/>`_, then `in prep school MP in France in 2015/16 <https://perso.crans.org/besson/infoMP/>`_, `advanced algorithms at ENS Rennes in 2019 <https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/info1_algo1_2019/>`_, `introduction to Computer Science and History of Machines in 2020 <https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/intro_num_DEM_2020/>`_, and many more.

2. **GNU Bash**, is my second favorite language. You can do so much in just a few lines, I love it.
   - I use it daily as my shell, and wrote so many tiny scripts that I regularly rediscover some of the old ones...
   - I use it for my `uLogMe fork <https://github.com/Naereen/uLogMe/`_ for self-quantified on your laptop,

3. **OCaml**, is my third favorite language, even if I mainly used and use it for teaching it (`see this list <https://naereen.github.io/#teaching>`_) ;
4. **Julia** that I discovered during my PhD thesis, I love it but unfortunately I didn't use it as much as I would have liked it. I published `two tiny packages <https://naereen.github.io/#julia>`_ on Julia Pkg manager ;
5. **LaTeX**, is not exactly a programming languages (even though it is Turing complete) but the best typesetting system in the world - I love it! Of course I wrote `my PhD thesis in LaTeX (on GitHub) <https://github.com/Naereen/phd-thesis/>`_, and all my `research articles <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bt3upq8AAAAJ>`_ in LaTeX. I use LaTeX for `slides <slides/>`_ of course, and many other use. I am proud to have tried stupid experiments, like `this one using Pokémon instead of page numbers <https://github.com/Naereen/LaTeX-article-with-Pokemon-numbering/>`_ ;
6. **Javascript**, even if I'm not an expert user, I did `write a few projects <https://naereen.github.io/#visualizations>`_ `in Javascript <https://naereen.github.io/#javascript>`_, usually by using a lot of code from other people, like `this awesome Turing machine simulator that I translated to French <https://github.com/Naereen/jsTuring_fr/>`_ ;
7. **HTML** and **CSS** (I know they're not programming languages, duh), same remarks I use them a lot for web-pages and `visualizations online <https://naereen.github.io/#visualizations>`_ ;
8. **Markdown** (and to a lesser extent reStructuredText) ;
9. **Java** ? Haha no, I don't like it - I would rather have to write **MATLAB**/**Octave** again !
10. And other that I would like to learn more: **GoLang**, **Rust**, **TypeScript**.
