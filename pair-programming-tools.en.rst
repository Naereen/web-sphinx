 Tools for pair-programming
############################

This short article lists different tools that a group of (at least two) people can use to work collaboratively on code and do efficient pair-programming.

.. note:: I never used any of these tools, I never had any occasion to do pair-programming even though I want(ed) to...

Generic tools
-------------

- `Use Together <https://www.use-together.com/fr/>`_ is free in its simplest version, and seems to support any application not a specific IDE,
- `Team Viewer <https://www.teamviewer.com/en/latest-release/>`_ seems to do the same job,
- `CodeShare <https://codeshare.io/>`_ seems pretty good too!

Plugins for IDE
---------------

And of course there are also solutions designed for one (or more) IDE:

- `Gitduck <https://gitduck.com/>`_ is free and works for Visual Studio Code and other less popular IDE.

- `Floobits <https://floobits.com/>`_ seems to be designed to share terminal windows, and has plugins for GNU Emacs, Neovim, VS Code and Atom,

- `Saros <https://www.saros-project.org/>`_ works currently for IntelliJ or Eclipse, so it's a good solution for Java programmers.

- `Visual Studio Code live-share <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/>`_ for `Visual Studio Code <visual-studio.en.html>`_ the generic open-source IDE made by Microsoft, one of the most used editor in the world (very good software, see `the page I wrote about it <visual-studio.en.html>`_).

- `Teletype for Atom <https://teletype.atom.io/>`_ for Atom the generic open-source editor made by GitHub. There is also other packages, like `MotePair <https://atom.io/packages/motepair>`_.

- `RemoteCollab for Sublime Text 2/3 <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RemoteCollab>`_, a generic close-source IDE, pretty popular but less and less popular (I used to like it and use it, for about 4 years, see `the page I wrote about it <sublimetext.en.html>`_).


Online IDE
----------

- `CodeAnyWhere <https://codeanywhere.com/>`_ is one of the most popular and most complete,
- `PythonTutor <https://pythontutor.com/>`_ works for Python 2 and 3, JavaScript and Java, and it's amazing and I use it for my `teaching activities <teaching.en.html>`_ (but limited to one small file),
- `Cloud9 <https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/>`_ by Amazon AWS, is generic and powerful.


Tools for only one OS
---------------------

- `Tuple App <https://tuple.app/>`_ is for Mac OS.
