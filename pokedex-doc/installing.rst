Installing the pokedex library
==============================

Quick startup with Ubuntu/Debian-like systems
---------------------------------------------

Run the following from an empty directory::

    $ sudo apt-get install git python python-pip python-sqlalchemy
    $ git clone git://github.com/veekun/pokedex.git
    $ pip install -E env -e pokedex
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env)$ pokedex setup -v
    (env)$ pokedex lookup eevee

If it all goes smoothly, you can now use ``env/bin/pokedex``, the command-line
tool, and ``env/bin/python``, a Python interpreter configured to use the
pokedex library.

That is all you need. Feel free to skip the rest of this chapter if you're not
interested in the details.

Prerequisites
-------------

Linux
^^^^^

Ubuntu/Debian users should run the following::

    $ sudo apt-get install git python python-pip

With other Linuxes, install the packages for git, python (2.6 or 2.7,
*not* 3.x), and python-pip.

If you succeeded, skip the Detailed instructions.

Detailed instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should know what a command line is and how to work with it.
The here we assume you're using Linux [#]_, if that's not the case, make
sure you have enough computer knowledge to translate the instructions to your
operating system.

Pokedex is distributed via Git_. So, get Git.

You will also need Python_ 2; the language pokedex is written in. Be sure to get
version **2.6** or **2.7**. Pokedex does not work with Python 3.x yet, and it
most likely won't work with 2.5 or earlier.

Next, get pip_, a tool to install Python packages. Experts can use another
tool, of course.

Make sure git and pip are on your path.

Optionally you can install SQLAlchemy_, `Python markdown`_, Whoosh_,
or construct_. If you don't, pip will atuomatically download and install a copy
for you, but some are pretty big so you might want to install it system-wide.
(Unfortunately, many distros have outdated versions of these libraries, so pip
will install pokedex's own copy anyway.)

Getting and installing pokedex
------------------------------

Run the following from an empty directory::

    $ git clone git://github.com/veekun/pokedex.git
    $ pip install -E env -e pokedex

This will give you two directories: pokedex (containing the source code and
data), and env (a virtualenv_).

In env/bin, there are three interesting files:

* pokedex: The pokedex program
* python: A copy of Python that knows about pokedex and its prerequisites.
* activate: Typing ``source env/bin/activate`` in a shell will put
  pokedex and our bin/python on the $PATH, and generally set things up to work
  with them. Your prompt will change to let you know of this. You can end such
  a session by typing ``deactivate``.

This documentation will assume that you've activated the virtualenv, so
``pokedex`` means ``env/bin/pokedex``.

Advanced
^^^^^^^^

You can of course install into an existing virtualenv, by either using its pip
and leaving out the ``-E env``, or running the setup script directly::

    (anotherenv)$ cd pokedex
    (anotherenv)pokedex$ python setup.py develop

It is also possible to install pokedex system-wide. There are problems with
that. Don't do it. The only time you need ``sudo`` is for getting the
prerequisites.

Loading the database
--------------------

Before you can do anything useful with pokedex, you need to load the database::

    $ pokedex setup -v

This will load the data into a default SQLite database and create a default
Whoosh index.

Advanced
^^^^^^^^

If you want to use another database, make sure you have the corresponding
`SQLAlchemy engine`_ for it and either use the ``-e`` switch, (e.g.
``-e postgresql://@/pokedex``), or set the ``POKEDEX_DB_ENGINE`` environment
variable.

To use another lookup index directory, specify it with ``-i`` or the
``POKEDEX_INDEX_DIR`` variable.

Make sure you always use the same options whenever you use pokedex.

If you're confused about what pokedex thinks its settings are, check
``pokedex status``.

See ``pokedex help`` for even more options.

All done
--------

To verify that all went smoothly, check that the pokedex tool finds your
favorite pok√©mon::

    $ pokedex lookup eevee

Yes, that was a bit anti-climatic. The command-line tool doesn't do much,
currently.
