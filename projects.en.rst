Studies and past jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* From mid-July 2014 to mid-May 2015, I **lived and worked in India**, `on the campus <https://goo.gl/maps/CcL2c>`_ of the new `Mahindra École Centrale <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/faculties.php>`_ (a new *Engineering College* born from a partnership between the `(Indian) Mahindra group <http://www.mahindra.com/>`_ and `(French) École Centrale de Paris <http://www.ecp.fr/>`_).
  I was the first French faculty to work there full-time, and `I have been involved as a teaching assistant professor <http://mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/faculty.php?fid=26>`_, in charge of `mathematics <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/portal/course/info.php?id=7>`_ `tutorials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorials#Tutorial_class>`_, and in charge of the Computer Science CS101 course for the second semester!

* In 2013/2014, I prepared the (French) `agregation of Mathematics <http://agreg.org/>`_ exam
  (national competitive exam for "*Prep Schools*" teacher recruitment, with a major in Maths and a minor in Computer Science). `I have been ranked 23rd  <http://web.archive.org/web/20140709144720/agreg.org/ResultatsMerite2014.html>`_, for 275 available positions, for 795 candidates allowed to pass the oral exam (second step) in June and July 2014, and almost 1200 persons registered in October 2013. I also did the second year of my **Master of Science** in Fondamental **Mathematics** (major) and **Computer Science** (minor), with a `speciality on teaching <http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/preparation-a-l-agregation/contenu-de-la-preparation/m2fesup-214836.kjsp>`_.

* In 2012/2013, I did the first year of the **MPRI** (`Master of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_science>`_ specialized in theoretical research in Computer Science, in Paris)
  and also the first year of the `Master of Science`_ in fondamental mathematics of ÉNS Cachan, again both `magna cum laude`_.

* From 2011/2012, I studied at `ÉNS Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/>`_, and in July 2012, I completed two `Bachelor of Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_science>`_, one in **Mathematics** and one in **Computer Science**,
  both `magna cum laude <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magna_cum_laude>`_.

* During two years, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, I studied in Marseille, at `Lycée Thiers <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Thiers>`_, first in MPSI 2 and after in MP\*1.

* Before that, I lived in `Briançon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briançon>`_ (Hautes-Alpes, *France*), and I got my `scientific baccalauréat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at#S.C3.A9rie_scientifique_.28S.29>`_, with a major in maths and a minor in theater, in 2009.

   **A few words about me**:

   I like to walk, travel, go camping around France and Europe, mainly by using `hitch-hiking <autostop.en.html>`_.
   I also like using new technologies, and enjoy design small games, or tiny pieces of software or web content
   (for instance `some nice javascript hacks <http://lbesson.bitbucket.org/README.html>`_), geeky tutorials (e.g. about `ga-beacon <beacon.fr.html>`_, `GNU/Nano <NanoSyntax.html>`_, `Wolfram|Alpha <wolfram.html>`_, `Sublime Text 3 <sublimetext.en.html>`_ or `git <tutogit.en.html>`_),
   or Linux command line tools (`see this page for example <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin>`_).

   **A few words about this site**:

   I am working on this little website (currently, `<http://perso.crans.org/besson/>`_)
   when I have the time, hoping it can be useful to someone.
   :gray:`All the content of the website is (C) Lilian BESSON, and it is open source with the` `GPLv3 License <LICENSE.html>`_.
   `What means Open Source, explained with LEGO? <https://youtu.be/a8fHgx9mE5U>`_.
   This site's *Google Analytics* data suggest that some pages are indeed visited on a daily basis,
   so if you are here for something in particular, I hope you will not be disapointed
   (you can use `this bug tracker <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/issues/new>`_ to report any bug, or even to ask me anything).

Some projects on-line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some of my profile pages on some great website:

  #. either with my *bitbucket* account `bitbucket.org/lbesson <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson>`_;
  #. or with my personal *Wikipedia* page `User:Naereen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Naereen>`_;
  #. or on *Transifex* `profile/Naereen <https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/Naereen/>`_ (almost not used anymore).


MSc internship : "*Towards modularity for planning and robot programs verification*"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I did a research internship for the third semester of my Maths MSc and CS MSc from 03 June to 09 August 2013.

.. sidebar:: Résumé

   My *résumé* is available here `<cv.pdf>`_.
   It is realized with ``LaTeX``, and the package *moderncv*.


I worked at **UCL** (:under:`University College of London`),
under the direction of `Jules Villard <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Villard/>`_ (who quotes me `on his new page <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jvillar1/>`_, and `Peter O'Hearn <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/>`_,
about separation logic, planning in `AI`, and the study of *modularity* in those two domains.

My report (in English): `<rapportM1Info13.pdf>`_, and my slides (in French): `<slidesM1Info13.pdf>`_.

:Mark: Jules gave me **19/20**. I got the mark **17.7/20** from the Computer Science jury at ENS Cachan, and **18.50/20** from the Maths jury at ENS Cachan.
