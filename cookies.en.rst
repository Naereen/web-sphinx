 Not so personnal data about the user of this website

Cookies use policy
------------------

Using this site **does not** require you to send or give any personal data.

Every visitor is clearly informed that a *cookie* might be
stored on his computer by visiting the website.

Such a *cookie* **does not** allow the website to personaly identify the user.
*Usually*, a *cookie* can store any information regarding the browsing
history of a user on one website (consulted pages, dates and hours of viewing etc),
and that history can be read later for every visit.

*But not here* !
On my website, only two *cookies* are used :

#. A really small text file called ``layoutstyle``, to store the color style chosen by the user
   (a simple value, either *'green'*, or *'orange'* or the default one, *'purple'*).
   It is possible to change the color style of these pages by using the letters 's' or 'S' on your keeboard.
   A small interactive window allow then to choose your favorite color
   (there is also a short message to recall that a *cookie* will be stored to save this choice).
   All this require `javascript <js.html>`_ to be actived.

#. An other incredibly small file is used by Sphinx to store a list of browsing parameters,
   now useless because I basically changed every single line in the default
   `layout.html <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/src/master/.templates/layout.html>`_ template file.


How to deal with cookies
------------------------
.. note:: More details

   `This website <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/>`_
   is dedicated to explain everything about *cookies*,
   and therefore is really more complete than the following explanation.

   For instance, you can also check out `wikihow.com/Disable-Cookies <http://www.wikihow.com/Disable-Cookies>`_.


A user can decide to block *cookies*, and therefore no cookies
will be stored (and, obviously, the related functionalities won't work).

You should know how to do it by yourself on your computer, but there is a
`google research link to learn how to do it <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+prevent+cookies+from+being+stored+in+my+computer+%3F>`_.

You can also simply display the cookies:
