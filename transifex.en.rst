 Translation de BitBucket.org

   This page is in *english*.
   Maybe you would like to see it in `french <transifex.fr.html>`_.


On Tuesday, March 26, `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ announced
a discreet message advising of the proposed translations of the site.

Curious, I went take a look at the software.

Translation **EN** :math:`\rightarrow` **FR**
--------------------------------------------
Transifex
^^^^^^^^^
 That's how the translation platform they used is called.

 A few moments later, I had created an account,
 and I therefore chair me for this translation project (see 
 `profile/Naereen  <https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/Naereen/>`_).

 Barely time to get a coffee (it was 5:06 in the morning ^^),
 that my application had been validated by the administrator
 `Justen Stepka <https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/jstepka/>`_.

Progress
^^^^^^^^

 The translation was advanced at **11%** when I logged in,
 with the sober figure of 1389 phrases or words to translate.

Translation interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Here is a preview of the interface:

Difficulties encountered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The main difficulie is the fact of not being alone to translate.

 `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com>`_ platform offers a multi-user edition.

 And fortunately!

 It significantly accelerates the work.

 Except when the other translator is using absurd terms,
 as *ticket* for issues.
 Or when he decided to translate email by mail,
 ignoring that in French we say *courriel*.

 Otherwise, to translate the terms technical *push*, *pull*, *commit*, *tag*,
 *head*, *master*, *merge*, *fork*
 and others prove to be relativly hard to translate.

 Suddenly, fork was kept as *fork* in French because neither he (**oliv.rm**)
 or me have found a correct term instantly.

  **Any idea is welcomed :)!**

Result
------
 The following embedded diagram should show the result (in real time)
 of the evolution of translations for bitbucket.org website :

Nice graphic right ?

The French translation has reached 100%, within 12 h 30, 
and is therefore the first completed.

**Congrats to us !**

A few revisions later, and to 1 pm it was really finished.

And after?
----------
 This little adventure got me interested in translation projects,
 and I think I'll look at make it **more regularly** !
