 Translation of BitBucket.org

   This page is in *english*.
   Maybe you would like to see it in `french <transifex.fr.html>`_.


On Tuesday, March 26, `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ announced
a discreet message advising of the proposed translations of the site.

Curious, I went take a look at the software.

Translation **EN** *→* **FR**
-----------------------------
Transifex
^^^^^^^^^
 That's how the translation platform they used is called.

 A few moments later, I had created an account,
 and I therefore chair me for this translation project (see 
 `profile/Naereen  <https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/Naereen/>`_).

 Barely time to get a coffee (it was 5:06 in the morning ^^),
 that my application had been validated by the administrator
 `Justen Stepka <https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/jstepka/>`_.

Progress
^^^^^^^^

 The translation was advanced at **11%** when I logged in,
 with the sober figure of 1389 phrases or words to translate.

Translation interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Here is a preview of the interface:

Encountered difficulties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The main difficulie is the fact of not being alone to translate.

 `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com>`_ platform offers a multi-user edition.

 And fortunately!

 It significantly accelerates the work.

 Except when the other translator is using terms different than mine,
 as *ticket* for issues, and I wanted to use *bug* or 
 *signalement de bug*.

 But the collaboration went well, and I think this highly increase
 the translation's quality.

 Otherwise, to translate the terms technical *push*, *pull*, *commit*, *tag*,
 *head*, *master*, *merge*, *fork*
 and others prove to be relativly hard to translate.

 Suddenly, fork was kept as *fork* in French because neither he (**oliv.rm**)
 or me have found a correct term instantly.

 .. note:: Update

    Someone decided to use "*bifurcation*" to design a "fork",
    and "*bifurquer*" to design the verb "to fork".

Result
------
 The following embedded diagram should show the result (in real time)
 of the evolution of translations for bitbucket.org website :

  **Nice graphic right ?**
  The French translation has reached 100%, within 12 h 30, 
  and is therefore the first completed.

  **Congrats to us !**
  A few revisions later, and to 1 pm it was really finished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And after?
----------
  This little adventure got me interested in translation projects,
  and I think I'll look at make it **more regularly** !

Offer me a to do a translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  So, if you are interested in a translation
  (FR → EN or
  EN → FR)
  of your website, software or otherwise
  do not hesitate to `contact me <index.html>`_.

Update their web-service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  I think the web site *transifex* is awesome !

  But, the lack of statistics overview for a translation project appears to
  be annoying, so I asked them `here on support.transifex.com 
  <http://support.transifex.com/customer/en/portal/questions/908374-see-some-statistics-for-a-translation-project-?new=908374>`_
  if there is a way to add this kind of functionnality.

More screenshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
