 Rules and principles - a long list of ideas that I like and try to apply in my life
#####################################################################################

.. todo:: Finish this page, first written on Wednesday 17th of March 2021!

This page is inspired by the work of `Bret Victor <http://worrydream.com/>`_, mainly this inspirational video `« Inventing on Principles » <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII>`_. I loved his vision of **living your life driven by principles**, and fighting and standing for them.

For all the following sections and categories, I will try to sort some advices I can give, some rules I try to live for, some principles that I wish to defend, or ideas that I like and want to try to apply more in my own life.

**This page, as most of the similar pages on my website, is intended for a personal use more than anything else.**
I will also try to give links to personal websites of inspirational people or authors, or great tutorials about various topics, if possible.

.. warning:: Please keep in mind that this page is a draft, and reflect my own personal point-of-view, not the ones of my employers, past present or future. This page will change, and in fact I would love if you contact me to show me that I'm wrong, that my ideas are not optimal or not good for such or such reason. Please `contact me <callme.en.html>`_ by email or other ways (e.g., open an issue `on my AMA on GitHub <https://GitHub.com/Naereen/ama/issues/new>`_).

.. warning:: Also, please keep in mind that ALL the content of this page should be read like every sentence started with *« In my opinion, ... »* and finished by *« ... but of course I'm probably wrong, please do help me to change my mind and improve my ideas ! »*.

This page is already quite long, and I don't intend on trying to keep it short, but rather as complete and detailed as I it can be.


Top 10 rules and principles
---------------------------

.. todo:: Try to summarize my main rules with just 10 points?

Life philosophy
---------------

.. todo:: Try to summarize my life philosophy?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friends and family
------------------

- If you want your friends and family to be able to help you, and if you want to trust them, then you should be trustworthy, help them, and be a fidel and trustworthy friend and family relative ;

- **Don't be afraid to ditch toxic people from your life**, especially wrongly-chosen partners or friends of friends, or colleagues.
    - It is harder for family members, but you can always try to have less frequent and less intense contacts with someone, if your relationship does not satisfy you.
    - It is also harder for colleagues, especially for your boss, but you can always ask to work with someone else, you have the right to change job if you're unhappy there, etc.

- **When in a new city, don't wait to meet new people**.
    - It can be using CouchSurfing, "On Va Sortir" or Facebook events to meet locals for fun events ;
    - You have the right to go alone in bars, restaurants, and other social places, and try to meet people there. It's easier in bars, especially bars that have games like board games, card or dice games, or exterior games ;
    - You have the right to ask a group of stranger friends to join them, even if you don't know them, especially in bars or parks when a small group of nice or fun looking strangers are playing card games or games like French "pétanque" ;
    - You can even do that for people older than you, or slightly younger than you! Don't every try this for people less than 18 or highschool students, or potential students in University ;
    - You can also use dating apps or websites, like Tinder or OkCupid to meet new friends, or sexual or romantic partners if you want ;
    - Try as early as possible to be friendly and nice to your new colleagues (or comrades in school), and don't be afraid to offer to meet outside of work/office, even on your first week!

- Never be afraid of talking to a new stranger, if you are sure that you don't annoy them in the process, and if you are ready to directly stop the interaction at the first hint of possible negative feeling on their part.

Online communications
---------------------

- Disable any software that can indicate to your contact when you are logged in, like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Discord etc: your friends should not be able to follow your activity patterns ;
- **I prefer to use email for professional stuff** (coding, teaching, administrative work, research etc), **and instant messaging for friends and fun stuff** ;
- I always reply to emails, even from complete strangers ;
- I operate by `Crocker's Rules <http://sl4.org/crocker.html>`_, so do not hesitate to speak plainly and frankly ;
- The opinions are mine, especially on this website: I do not speak for my employers, either past, present or future ;

Technologies
------------

- Learn how to use all the major "numerical" technologies, they will be here for a long time ;

Concerning computer or laptops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Keep your computer up-to-date, especially for the operating system, and all software that you use to connect to Internet ;
- Your brain is the best anti-virus, and you best tool to protect yourself from spam and scam and piracy ;
- Never open a link without looking at the domain name and the address. If you use Safari or other shitty web-browsers, at least activate the option to see in the status bar the links before clicking them...
- Configure your laptop to not connect automatically to any Wifi networks ;

Concerning Smartphone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Keep your computer up-to-date, especially for the operating system, and all software that you use to connect to Internet ;
- Never keep your location activated, except actively when using an app that requires your location for good reason (like Google Maps). The same goes for Bluetooth !
- Never keep your Blue
- I always put my phone in airplane mode when sleeping: my sleep is more important than the external world. This might not be applicable to you if you have kids or parents or relatives that you feel responsible for and who could need to be able to join you at anytime.

Back-up for your phone or computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Regularly, on different hard-drive ;

My thoughts on non-open source software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ban them ;
- fight against them ;
- convince your friends, family, students and colleagues that they can do like you!

My thoughts on open source software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- adopt them ;
- love them ;
- convince your friends, family, students and colleagues that they can do like you!
- you have the right to check out the code of any open-source software, so try it!
- you can contribute to any open-source software, and if you do contribute and you are not warmly welcomed in the community of this software, you can (and should) consider to stop using it ;
- you can contribute even for changing one line, one word, one letter in the code or documentation of any open-source project, and in fact, if you see a typo anywhere in an open-source website or software, it's your responsibility to notify the developers and try to fix the mistake yourself! I do this a lot, for instance `I changed a few times one letter in OCaml documentation <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commits?author=Naereen>`_.

Web and online documents
------------------------

- **Anything that has ever been accessible on a website is online forever** : Google and Yahoo and Bing crawlers are incredibly fast, Microsoft and Facebook and Twitter most probably aspire and copy the data behind any links you paste in any of their service, etc. Even if you own your website, and you upload document ``a.pdf``, delete it the next day, you have no warranty that Google bot hasn't already cached your document (which they do for evil purposes and to improve their search engine and offer a cached version of website), or that it hasn't already been archived on `web.archive.org <https://web.archive.org/>`_ or any other online archive ;

- Don't upload any documents you don't have rights on, especially electronic copies of books or music, photographs of public building, persons etc ;

Your Photographies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Before you upload one photo of yourself anywhere, even on "private" servers like emails or Facebook messages, you have to understand that this photo will be online **forever**, and that the person you send ;
- The same applies if you upload a photo on a public server, like a Facebook or Instagram profile picture, except now anyone on the planet can do these things ;
- As soon as one of your photo is publicly available somewhere online, you need to know that now anybody can recognize you in group photo, in a crowd, in the street etc. It is not a major threat to your life or privacy, but it is a threat and a risk, that I do not want to suffer from ;
- Never upload the photographies of anyone else, or a photo of yourself with other people: even if they give you the right to do so on day 1, maybe next month or in 10 years they would want their picture to be deleted, and you most probably will not be able to do so.

- Tips: if you need to send a picture to someone, add a unique watermark on it (e.g., "sent to Superman on 2021-03-17 at 21h45h12s, by Facebook Messenger"), and on different parts of its metadata, so that if this picture is directly leaked with no modification of the watermark and metadata, you will know who is responsible. The same precaution is even more valid if your picture or video is naughty and you really don't want it to become public ;

- **My rule has always and will always be : never upload a photo of myself anywhere on the Internet** ;
- And never send a picture of yourself to anybody, except maybe very close friends or family, using end-to-end encrypted messages or one-time paste-bin from my own `OwnCloud <https://owncloud.org/>`_ instance ;
- **I will aggressively react against anyone who uploads or uses a photo of myself online**, even in "private" use like in emails or Facebook messages. I will go as far as suing you, if you do that and refuse to delete it as soon as possible ;

- **I will never allow for a picture or photograph of myself to be released in public, especially not on YouTube or Facebook**.


Your voices
~~~~~~~~~~~

- With the increasing powers of "deep fake" technologies, one could be worried about the risk of using publicly available samples of one's voice (e.g., in a video lecture you uploaded to YouTube) to forge a model of that voice, and then use it to scam your friends of family, or steal your identity ;
- If you feel concerned about these risks, the simple solution is to: a) never upload a video (even with no webcam or image) of yourself speaking to any public website (especially Google's YouTube), b) never allow the recording of any of your public intervention in scientific conference or other things ;
- If you feel concerned but you already leaked some content of your voice, I guess you should: a) delete these sound extracts, b) try to hunt all of them down, c) ask your friends whom you sent voice messages to delete their files and attachments from Messenger and WhatsApp etc ;
- If you feel extra concerned about you, be careful when answering your phone from an unknown number, especially at late hours, it could be someone calling you just in order to get a long-enough recording of your voice, in order to later forge a model of your voice and use it to harm or scam you.

I think I am almost as concerned about this potential threat as my last bullet point suggest, but not yet willing to be paranoid about it.

Your videos
~~~~~~~~~~~

- I guess the same things apply to your face and body images and videos, combining my points-of-view on pictures and voice ;
- **I will never allow for a video of myself to be released in public, especially not on YouTube or Facebook**.

I am extremely concerned about this aspect, and I am proud to have been able to work as a researcher for four years and as a professor of computer science since 2019, while refusing to have any videos of my lectures or scientific presentations recorded in public.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teaching
--------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coronavirus crisis
------------------

- I wash my hands before exiting home and when coming home, before/after eating or going to the bathroom, and before/after any class ;
- I no longer eat or drink in public if I can avoid it, and in a bus or train I never remove my mask, for any reason ;
- I always wear a mask when I'm not at home, in the street, at friends, in my University, in the bus, in stores, etc. I try to change my mask if I wear it for more than a few hours ;
- I only wear chirurgical masks, and usually take a new one every day when I go to work or buy things or walk in my neighborhood. I estimated at less than 45€ the money I spent on masks between March 2020 and January 2021 (I don't go out very much!) ;
- I refuse to enter a shop if the owner or someone inside has no mask ;
- Most probably, I will consider you as stupid if I see you not wearing your mask correctly in public, especially it you wear it only on your mouth and not your nose (or the other way around), or under your chin while drinking, eating or (even worse) smoking!
- I now also refuse to enter a bus if the driver does not his/hear mask correctly, or at least I try to talk to them. I have already notified Star, the Rennes transport organization, about insults and threats I received (twice) from drivers, when I was politely asking them why they had no mask on. I will continue to do so: as publicly highly visible workers, they have to give the best example.

Money and how to not spend it
-----------------------------

- **Act as a responsible consumer: what you buy has an impact** ;
- Every cents and euros (or dollars or whatever money) you spend on anything has an impact
- Don't buy something except if you really need it ;
- Never spend any amount of money before taking the time to know to whom it will go, and for what it will be used ;
- If you buy something from a new shop, a new bakery, a new bar, a new restaurant etc, before you accept to spend any money there, you should try to be curious about the shop. Where do they buy their beer, who owns the shop, where is made the t-shirt you are looking at, where goes the 20€ for this CD, etc. If someone in a shop refuses to be open about these details, maybe you can just take your business elsewhere. It is especially true for bakeries and any shop who sells food: you have the right to ask for lots of details (what kind of flour, where was it produced, how many employees work here etc) ;


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alimentation and food
---------------------

Except if you really are low on money, you can live and sustain yourself without buying and consuming meat and fish, and without buying anything that comes in plastic and non-recyclable wrappings.

TL;DR: TODO: summarize my position on alimentation and food.

- **Go vegetarian, seriously**. Or at least, you should consider reducing drastically the amount of meat and fish product that you buy. Or at least at least, buy twice as less but twice as good and twice as expensive meats, aim at locally produced and ecological and biological meat ;
- I don't really care about the impact of this change in your diet on your health, even if it can have some positive impact, but I care about the ecological costs and moral implications of consuming meat and fish, and you should care too ;

- **Don't buy meat and fish and living things in general** (even if they're dead when you buy them) ;
- If you would not be willing to kill yourself the animal or animal piece that you just bought or ate, how come you accept that someone else killed it for you?

- If you consume a lot of dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurts and ice-creams, you should know about the ecological and moral costs of having animals (mostly cows) in farms. Most milk cows are raised only for milk, but they are inseminated artificially, and you should read this as it is: cows raped regularly using huge mechanical machines, with no consideration for their pain or well-being ;

- I could be mistaken, but if you buy organic (bio') eggs from a local farm, and not too much, you're fine. Chickens don't need to have a cock around and to be fertilized to produce eggs, and if they live in a small farm and outside and in a good environment, from what I read, they are pretty much as happy as possible ;
- There are eggs or milk products in almost any pre-processed food, as well as worse products such as palm oil, conservatives, colorants and more, so read carefully the labels before buying anything ;

- **Don't buy anything that comes from far away if a local alternative exists, and try to remove anything that comes from far away**. I haven't bought bananas or pineapples since a few years, and I don't miss them!
- **Ban palm oil from anything you buy** ;
- **Reduce as much as you can your consumption of product grown far away**, including tea, sugar, coffee, chocolate and non-seasonal vegetables and fruits ;
- **Don't buy any fruit or vegetable that is not from the current season**, or only sparsely and occasionally. I do buy like one or two tomatoes between October and June, when I really want a fresh tomato in the winter, and even if it's not perfect, it's not as bad as buying any vegetable anytime, and it stays exceptional (and I aim at local producer) ;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About drugs
-----------

**TL;DR: I'm trying to completely stop alcohol, despite my long-time liking of beers and alcohol. I am fighting against cigarettes, and against all sorts drugs.**

About alcohol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: I aim at completely removing alcohol from my diet, and I have never been a heavy drinker and almost never drunk in my life. I love beers and wines and cocktails and home-made digestive, but I try to drink as little and as infrequently as possible (once a week or once a month), and you should do too!**

- **Yes, alcohol is a drug**. It is actually recognized as one of the most addictive drug on the market, and it is directly and indirectly responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in all the countries on the world, far more than terrorism or wars ;
- **Yes, you can live without it. Yes, you can have fun without it**. And most probably, you should drink less ;

- Yes, you have the right to host a party or a dinner with friends or family with no alcohol. If any one gives you a hard time about it, don't let them tease you, stand up for yourself and explain your position. If they don't like it, maybe they shouldn't be invited next time, and they can also leave right now! It happened to me, and will most surely happen again, I'm not afraid of it.

- TODO: write more?

- When buying alcohol, even low-degree alcohol like beer or wine, follow the same rules as for any other kind of food or products: only buy from your own country, aim at the most local things (the only beer I buy since a few years are all made in Rennes or Cesson-Sévigné, less than 5 km away from my place), and buy as less as you can ;

About cigarettes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: I am and have always been actively against cigarettes, smoking and tobacco. I dream of a society who would ban cigarettes and tobacco world-wide, and fight against it as harshly as against cocaine and heroin.**

- Just don't smoke, don't try, don't buy cigarettes ;
- No but seriously, don't ;
- Your smoke is poison and is toxic to anybody, don't force it on people ;
- Despite what many people think, it is forbidden to smoke in any area of a public bus or train station, if it is outside near the station platforms. I had and will continue to relentlessly fight against this uncivil gesture, and I am proud to have the gusts to annoy you if you do smoke there. It is one of the area where cigarettes are the most not correctly thrown in garbage bins, and this is outrageous ;

- I tend to be much more reluctant to give money to homeless people if I see that they smoke or have cigarettes. I also tend to be much less nice and helpful if someone is smoking in public ;

- If you do smoke, please respect at least the following rules (which are in the French law!): don't smoke inside bars, restaurants, public transport such as buses or trains, and even outside in the streets or parks, don't smoke close to people and especially children ;
- If you smoke and do not throw away your cigarettes in a bin, or in a personal box that you keep for this purpose, then you are a) stupid, b) a pig, c) responsible for the up-coming pollution of up-to 500 liters of clean water (yes, 500L with just one cigarette butt), d) you should pick this cigarette up and throw it correctly ;
- I had and will continue to relentlessly fight against this uncivil gesture, and I am proud to have the gusts to annoy you if you don't dispose correctly of your shitty and dangerous butt cigarettes ;

- **Do you realise all their negative ecological and economical impact that your smoking have on the world?** Producing cigarettes requires to grow tobacco, on lands that could be used to grow vegetables, to dry it and then transform it in cigarettes (by worker who could cook delicious meals using said vegetables), they also need papers who could be used to produce books, and then fuel and gas to transport them from the other side of the world (spoiler alert, tobacco don't grow in organic farms in your neighborhood!). While you smoke, it destroys your throat, teeth, lungs and hair, and it does the same to your kids, friends and neighbors, and anyone who unluckily breath your smoke-of-death. Buying packets of cigarettes also produces wrapping and waste. The last and worst part is about cigarettes butts. So many of them finish in the oceans and rivers, and pollute clean water and destroy local and world-wild wilde life. But even if you throw away your cigarettes, in garbage bins, they are simply burned as there is no way to recycle such toxic waste. So all the toxic compounds (that partly poisoned you already) finish in the atmosphere...

- TODO: write more?

- Summary: if you smoke and are not aware of all this, and are not actively trying to stop, most likely I will consider you as stupid. I will try to explain this quickly if I have the chance, and if you don't change your habits, then there is no chance for us to be friends, and I'm not sorry. Be sorry for your negative impact and your toxic habits!


About recreational drugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By recreational drugs, I consider any substance such as weed or cannabis used for fun and recreational purposes, and cocaine, heroin, meth, poppers etc.

- Just don't ;
- No but seriously, don't ;
- All what I wrote about cigarettes above can apply to most drug: they are extremely bad for your health, for the environments, they are almost never produced in clean and respectful environments, and you cannot trust anyone who is selling to you an illegal substance on which you have no control ;
- Actually this last point is one of the thing that always puzzled me the most about any illegal drugs: **how can you trust someone who hides this substance in their socks, and who hides from cops, that they are indeed selling you the thing you want to smoke/consume?** And if you think a little bit more about all the steps that this piece of drug had to travel before arriving in your possession, how can you willingly accept to take part and finance such awful things?
- A good rule of thumb is: **if it's illegal to buy or possess, it's illegal to buy or possess. Easy right? So just don't.**

- If you are suffering from an addiction to such a drug, I am aware of how difficult it can be to stop the addiction. You can find help, there are free hotlines to call to search for information about fighting drug addictions, and you are not alone in this fight. You can succeed and fight yourself out of this toxic habit!
- Are you bored? Read Wikipédia, read a dictionary, talk to people, play video-games, listen to music, and many more activities that are virtually free (not like drugs), harmless (not like drugs), legal (not like drugs), and much fun!

- TODO: write more?

- Yes, I am aware of the possible health benefit and positive effects of medical cannabis. I guess I'm not against that, but this section is entitled "recreational drugs", not "medical drugs". My position here lies with the one of my government: as long as it will be illegal to buy such product, I will be against it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House and interior life
-----------------------

- I apply a very strict view of « My home, my rules » (*domus mea praecepta mea* in latin): if you come visit, even for a short time, follow my rules at home or don't come (that is one of the reason of this page). If we get into an argument because you did not respect one of my rules (e.g., you smoked inside, you got offended because I don't serve wine or beer, or anything else), I can and most probably will ask you to leave, no matter the hour ;

- I don't wear shoes inside my home, or anybody's home, I know that in USNA it's customary but it's just stupid and not hygienical: your shoes bring back every dirty things your feet touched outside, so you should leave your shoes outside of your main entrance door, or just inside after the door. In my home, I expect that you remove your shoes just when you arrive, and just before washing your hands!

- I listen to a lot of music, all the time, when alone at home. Except if a neighbor actively complains (they all have my phone number or can come knock, I have a paper on my door saying that I'm open to discussion anytime), I won't force myself to stop my music or even reduce the sound volume at any hour. None of my neighbors in Rennes ever complained about that, and I actively asked about it to my closest neighbors, nobody complained so I guess I'm fine ;

- I use a compost at home for anything that can go to a compost, and I expect you to use it (I can take care of it if you aren't used to), in particular don't throw away old vegetables and compostable garbage in the "normal bin" ;

- I almost don't bind anything that have wrapping, especially no plastic wrapping, and almost everything I eat is organic and based on vegetables, so I don't produce much waste, and therefore I empty my bins quite rarely. You too can succeed this!

- I ventilate my sleeping room in the morning and before going to be, and my living room twice a day as well. I had the habit of doing so way before the coronavirus crisis, but it is even more logical to do so nowadays.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exterior life and safety rules
------------------------------

- **Never leave your apartment/house without checking that you have your keys**.

.. sidebar:: I take this rule one step further: I always have my key attached to my belt and pants, and I have almost never walked from my room to my living room (where I can exit my appart) without said belt and pants. I got locked out of my student rooms a few times while studying at ENS Cachan, it was never a real problem as employees of the student housing service were always available nearby... but I also got locked out of my apparemment in Rennes in 2020 in one evening, and it was not a nice experience, to say the least (I had to climb a wall of 3.5m from my neighbor's garden).

- **Never leave your home without at least 50€**, or enough money to sleep in a hotel, buy a train or bus ticket to go see a friend, buy a disposable phone or similar things.
- Tips: you can buy for less than 20€ a utility belt that has an interior pocket when you ca n store some money, and more tiny things (like a small invisible wire, a spare key to your home, a tiny µ-SD card with backup of your important documents such as passport etc etc). This can save you from uncomfortable situations!

- If I'm outside and possibly interacting with people (in a street, a city bus, a shop), **I find it uncivilized to wear earplugs and listen to music, and I never do it** ;

- If going out for more than 15 minutes, you should have a bag, with a few things on it:
    - your wallet or at least a piece of identification (passport, ID card, driver's license etc) ;
    - drinking water ! In a glass or metal bottle, not a shitty plastic one ;
    - at least a book or something to read ot spend your time on (if you have to wait a couple of hours, and don't want to waste them) ;
    - one or more other bags (such as foldable plastic or tote bag), in case you buy or find more things ;
    - a couple of clean masks, and hand alcoholic solution ;
    - other things I always have on my bags include: *a solid plastic glass* to drink from, to order coffee or tea to go without using a disposable plastic cup, *a Swiss knife*, *a few pills of basic medecine* like anti-allergic anti-pain etc, *tissues*, *one plastic bag*, a detailed map of my city and especially with bus lines, pencils and a tiny notebook, a couple of stamps ;


Some rules I try to follow because I live alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have lived alone almost always since 2009, and I am very happy about that.
On the one hand it gives my all the freedom I need, on the other hand, it has some drawbacks and especially for my own safety.

- **When I'm traveling outside of my city, a few friends and/or family have details on my transportation** (e.g. timing and number of the trains). They also know where I'll be sleeping, with the exact address and phone number of the friend or hotel or stranger (using CouchSurfing) where I'll stay. Most of the times, it's quite easy: if I visit friend H. in Marseille, who is a close friend of my own friend A., I just have to say to A. « *I'll stay at H. until Monday, it's so cool but we'll miss you!* » ;

- **More generally, at least two friends will know if I'm going to sleep outside of my own home, even if it is in my own city**. They will know the name and phone number of the friend or partner where I'll sleep, and I'll be careful to text them again the next day so they don't get worried about me ;
- I could try to apply this rule more generally, as soon as I'm going for lunch or dinner somewhere outside my home and offices, but I haven't started yet ;

- If I buy something unusual, if I meet a new stranger, if I host a stranger or even a friend, I apply the same safety precautions and at least two friends will know. Most of the times, you don't have to write anything scary like : « hey C., I'm afraid to host this guy from CouchSurfing so here are his details, just in case he attacks me ... », but more something natural like « hey C., I thought you buddy because last time I hosted someone it was you, and tonight I'm hosting this girl from CouchSurfing, she's from Berlin and named Alice, here is her number if you ever need to reach her while in Berlin! She seems so nice! ».

- Lots of information about my professional work is available on my website(s) and professional social media accounts (i.e., GitHub and others), because I think it can only help me and help my colleagues if I happen to be unavailable for a lecture, ill or absent for a week, etc ;

- My parents or close friends have lots of details about my appartement, such as the digicode to enter, the phone number and details about my landlord, my main colleagues, my office(s), etc ;
- The same goes for my computer and cellphones, and main online accounts, I feel safer if they know how to use them if i'm unconscious or unable to do it myself.

I'm not an expert on these questions, but most probably if you live alone (or even if you live with a partner, roommates or other people), these ideas and rules can most surely apply to your personal situation and could prove to be useful.


Walking in the city
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **In a street, I tend to walk on the left side**, opposite of the cars in order to see them arriving in front of me and not in my back ;
- As I wrote below about cars, I consider cars and motorized vehicles to be our greatest enemies, in modern Western society. I'm almost never afraid of people, even when walking alone at night, but I'm often scared and afraid of cars on a daily basis. They drive too fast, not precautiously enough, and as a citizen living and working in a city with no dangerous hobbies (e.g., I don't hunt), the highest threat on my personal safety is a car accident ;

- **Never insult anyone**, and always consider an insult as a great offense: it's reprehensible by the law, and quite a serious offense ;
- **Never hit or reply to any oral threat, and only reply to defend yourself it you encounter any physical threat** ;
- Always put your own safety first, but in any case if you are witness to a violent situation, you have to intervene. It can be as simple as calling the police, taking pictures or recording a video or just the sound, or you can directly intervene, first to try to calm the different belligerents or to protect people being attacked from other people. If you're alone against more than one dangerous-looking person, you probably shouldn't try crazy things (don't be a dead hero), but these situations are extremely rare in civilized societies (i.e., not the USNA with their crazy guns). It is however most likely that you can stand up for the victims and help them, by simply stating that you are against the violence of unfair situation you are witnessing ;

- If you have to walk around with a valuable item such as a laptop, don't carry it on an obvious laptop bag, but rather in your backpack, it will be less an obvious target for thieves ;

- Never carry anything that you don't have the right to carry, such as drugs (see above) and weapons.


Walking in mountains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: I love hiking in mountains, and I am a very careful hiker, always prepared in order to have the nicest and safest possible experience during my hikes.**

- **Never ever ever litter or throw away things in the nature**. It is of course true in any environments, but most importantly true in remote and isolated natural spaces! Anything that you will throw, except natural compostable things (like a piece of bread), can last in the wild for dozen or up-to thousands of years. In a public park or a city, of course you also shouldn't litter, but most probably there are public services working here to clean-up after you, so the impact will be less ;

- **I always have more water in my bag than necessary**, usually I plan one litter for two hours, or one litter for one hour when hiking up on the mountain or if its very sunny. I also always pack tiny pills to clean-up and disinfect water, and so should you! They don't cost much, they last years, and they can be very efficient ;
- If you hike with me, I except that you will have everything in your bags for your own comfort and survival. However, I tend to be extra caring for my less-experienced friends, and most likely I'll have planed to pack extra food and water for you, if you accompany me to a hike ;

- **I always pack a map of the area where I'm going to hike, and so should you!** Apps on your phone like Google Maps are fine for city and roads and most natural environments such as forests and parks, but in the mountains, you can very easily find yourself in a location where you have no wireless Internet, or no GPS... You can also easily lost your phone, run out of battery, etc. Even in 2021, you have to learn how to use a regular 2D map printed on paper, and especially if you hike in mountainous areas.

Traveling
---------

**TL;DR: I fight to ban and drastically reduce planes and flights, cars and motorbikes. I dream of a world with a hundred times more public buses, a thousand times more personal bikes, and only local and short-distance holidays. I dream of a world of perfect public service like public buses and trains and no need for any personal motorized vehicles, except for fire-fighters and ambulances, for professional such as for agriculture and construction workers.**

Plane and airlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: I am highly in favor of deleting personal flights for tourism, and drastically reducing the number and frequency of plane travels.**

- In my opinion, to reduce the colossal ecological impact of the flight industry, we should aim at drastically reducing the number of planes in the world, and their frequency of travel ;
- The target should be to simply forbid long distance travel for holidays or tourism. If you want to move your life from India to Canada, or from Brazil to Norway, do it once, and then try to stay there as long as possible, and even if you're rich, don't come back too often. Ideally, in 5-10-20-50 years we should try to remove all this ;
- The world was functional and people were happy before the recent advent of the flight industry, we should aim at coming back to the simpler times for this ;

- Governments should simply and right away start taxing the flight fuel as much as the other fuels and the flight industry as much as the other industries, especially for local short-distance flights for which train alternative exists ;
- Scientific conferences should stay online after the coronavirus crisis, with more frequent local region- or country-wide events, and large worldwide conferences such as NeurIPS or ICML with thousands of participants should simply be forbidden to take place with the old model of having up-to 13_000 people flying from all around the world just for a few days of conference ;
- Flights for business men should also be reduced as drastically as possible ;

- I guess I would like to think that people shouldn't be allowed to travel so far away for not so much money, when such a long distance plane travel has such a drastic ecological foot-print ;

- I am guilty of having traveled about 54 times in a plane, for short (Paris - Rennes, once, Amsterdam - Rennes twice), middle (Marseille - Corsica, Paris - Florence, Geneva - Cadix) or longer distances (Paris - New Delhi four times, Nice - New York once). I am extremely lucky to have been able to travel that much when I was studying and in my first years of professional career as teacher and researcher (one year in India in 2014/15 and a few travels in close Europe in 2016-19 for my PhD). I recognize the positive effects on someone of traveling, discovering other countries and cultures, foreign cities and other places. I value traveling a lot ;
- In 2018, I started to learn about the carbon foot-print of the flight industry, and the ecological disaster that are planes and heavy-carbon plane fuels. I therefore pledged to never take a plane again, and sadly I was (almost) forced to fly four times in 2019 for my last travels during my PhD ;
- **From June 2019, I swore to never fly again, and I will be respecting this oath very strictly** ;
- Note that for many years, I dreamed of working abroad again, or in French islands in the Caribbean sea (Guadeloupe, Martinique) or in Africa (La Réunion). I was aiming at becoming a professor in prep'schools in La Réunion, but I now value my oath and ecological fights, much more than my former dreams, so I changed my mind.


Train
~~~~~

- I love train, they are the most ecological solution to travel far away (or even as close as 10 kilometers away). Train are clean, quiet, they don't move that much and allow you to work or read or even sleep in them ;

- I would like the European and French governments to sponsor more all the local ("TER") train lines rather than the most fancy TGV lines, and I am sadden to see that night train lines and less frequently traveled local lines are going extinct. It is nothing but a shame to see than less and less kilometers of train rail are kept every-year, when the tendency should be on the other direction ;

- Long train (or bus) travels are probably the only situation where I can listen to music from a smartphone or watch a movie on a laptop in public. I won't get offended if someone interrupts ;


Public bus
~~~~~~~~~~

- I don't like public bus, I prefer train, but whenever I need to go somewhere I can't or don't have the time to go by bike or by foot, I take the public bus ;
- Please **always pay your bus ticket**, validate your card etc. Seriously, these buses are public services, they are usually very trustworthy and reliable, and we need to have more and more buses lines. Please do your part and pay rightfully these buses!

- In Rennes, I like how most of the drivers are nice and very skilled. I like to say hi and chat a little bit whenever I can, and thank them for their great service. On the other hand, I am sadden to see that some bus driven can very quickly get aggressive and insult or even physically threaten you (it happened to me twice in a few months in 2021) if you calmly and nicely ask them why they are not wearing a mask...


Car
~~~

**TL;DR I'm highly against personal cars and other motorized machines like motorbikes! I pledge to never buy a car, to never drive any vehicle except for emergency or moving out, and I dream of a near future when only public buses, ambulances and delivery trucks will live on our roads.**

- **I hereby pledge that I will never buy a car**, a truck or any other motorized machines that come directly from Hell, kill hundreds of thousands people every year (RIP Thomas in 2019, Rémi in 2021), and pollute our atmosphere, public space and sound environments ;
- **I never understood how someone can enjoy driving**: you have to be constantly careful about every actions your body and your mind make, and the tiniest mistake can directly damage or destroy your car, cost you hundreds of euros of repair, and even a small mistake can kill you, your passenger or anyone in the street. Why would I ever want to do that again?
- I do think you should learn how to drive, because in an emergency situation it can be useful to know how to drive someone to a hospital, or to move a car which. **Learn how to drive, then maybe practice it once a year to not forget too quickly, but THAT'S IT** ;

- **I think people should buy a car only if they really cannot live without it**. If your work is 45 minutes away by bus and you buy a car to win 30 minutes a day, try to compute the time (and money!) you will lose at the end of year when taking into account how much time you have to spend cleaning your car, buying gas, etc. Most probably, you won't win anything!
- **I have a very strict point of view of personal motorized vehicles: for me, they should disappear as soon as possible.** Our modern society could and should adapt as fast as possible to exist without any personal cars or motorized machines. The only remaining motorized engines should be: a) public bus (by multiplying the number of lines by 50x and their frequency by 2-20x), b) public service like firefighter, ambulances, official mail delivery, c) long distance and large volume transportation of food and goods, d) for professionals like in agriculture and construction works, plumber and other workers. We should aim at simply deleting personal cars from our society, as well as useless Taxi, and simply increase like crazy the number, frequency and reliability of public buses lines, with several different size and categories ;

- **I don't like and I don't trust taxi**. In Rennes, taxi are loud, they drive too fast, they use the bus line when they shouldn't (I know the rules say they can, but does a taxi really should count as a public service, when it's only used by one rich person at a time? it's unfair). I think it would be very easy to just remove them: **governments could give a bus driver license to any taxi** or Uber driver, and they will know be civil servant with a fixed salary, working for the greater good rather than for their own benefit ;

- **I am even more against motorbikes and personal scooter**. The noise they make in cities is just too much, and almost anybody who has a scooter should be able to do the same travel by bike or public buses (and if you are not, the dream goal should be to enforce the local city of government to add a new bus line, not to solve your own problem by buying a polluting killer motorbike) ;

- **As long as personal cars will exist, I will continue to consider them as only negative things in the world**: a) the worst enemies to pedestrian in cities and any environments (and the biggest threat to one's safety and life), b) the biggest source of noise and air pollution in cities and alongside roads, c) possibly useful when hitch-hiking ;
- In fact, in my opinion, the development and authorization of manufacturing, selling and buying personal cars powered by gas and motors constitute one of the worst decision ever made by mankind, and one of the greatest failure of our modern society (dating back as old as in the 1920s). It was mainly promoted by the newly formed gas industry, for financial purposes, and even if it did bring more freedom to the individuals, the negative impact this whole industry had on the environment (mainly from an ecological point-of-view) is incredibly bad. Of course, I know that motorizing the agriculture industry allowed to increase the production, and motorizing firefighter and ambulances, and the delivery of food and goods all allowed to improve our life quality world-wide, but these are the only three kind of motorized vehicles I would to see in the street and in our world ;

- **Car only exist so that you can occasionally use the car of one of your friend or relative in holidays or for exceptional travels (like moving out), or hitch-hiking** ;

- I am not saying I will never drive again, most probably I will "have to" at some point, but I definitely don't want to drive on a regular basic (even once a week is far too frequent for me), and I won't ever buy gasoline or car fuel ;

- I consider than personal cars should have the lowest priority on the streets and roads and in cities, especially they should never have priority over bikes (see below), or pedestrians. You already illogically have the right to pollute our ears and air and atmosphere, to risk to kill us any time you move your evil metal monsters, and to take an absurd amount of public space, that's already far too many rights for a bunch of killing machines, don't you think?

- And for the last time, no, **my extreme position against car is not because I'm a bad driver**. I just really don't like it (kinda like programming in Java, I don't enjoy it, but I still know more than enough) ;
- And it also has nothing personal to do with my father who worked as driving instructor for 23 years, and who taught me how to drive in 2009-2012 ;

- For a long time, I had a dual and unsettled position regarding personal motorized vehicles such as camping car, on one hand I find them very cool and they are an amazing way to travel and enjoy your holidays (I grew up living 4 to 6 weeks in a camping car every year, between 3-yo and 17-yo), on the other hand they share all the negative aspects of personal cars such as noise and air pollution, dependance on gas, easiness of killing or hurting someone when you drive, etc. I long dreamed of buying and owing my own tiny camping car, but I dropped the dream, and will never follow it again. **My decision is now to be highly against camping cars as well** ;


Bikes
~~~~~

**TL;DR I'm highly in favor of a more global adoption of the bicycle as main transportation engine.**

- I'm against the boom of electrical bike. The only two reasons to buy such electrical bikes can be the following :

    - you don't have the physical capacity to bike to your work/school without the electrical assistance (e.g. it's hilly or too far away), and all your alternatives are more polluting (e.g., a car, a bus) ;
    - you don't have the physical capacity of using your bike for sport and to have fun, and this electrical assistance can help you do more sport ;

- I think people who owns a car should be advised or maybe even forced to also buy a bike, and we should globally promote a more frequent usage of our bikes, to short distances ;
- It's very convenient to go to a grocery store with your bike (or kick-scooter), you can put a lot of weights on your handlebars (by evening the weights, I can bring back much more weight than with my arms) ;
- Biking is good for your health ;
- You can hardly kill anyone using your bike, even if you drive fast and don't pay much attention, while it is surprisingly easy to hurt or kill someone when driving a car or a motorbike ;
- I dream of a society where bikes would be owned by virtually everybody, and will be so cheap that basically nobody would want to even steal your bike. I dream of cities with almost no parking spaces but large walking areas for pedestrians and large lines reserved for bikes.


**For my own safety and the safety of others:**

- **I always wear a green reflective vest and a helmet**, as well as reflective strips on my pants, and so should you! Not wearing a helmet on your bike is like driving with no seatbelt: okay it was weird at first, and it's not so convenient, but I can and it will save your life ;
- **I always wear tiny lights on my bike** (white in front and red in back), **as well as very bright personal light** on the torso. For ~50€ in Decathlon, you can buy these wearable lights that can be recharged using USB, and they can literally save your life from murdering cars that don't know how to drive. If you bike at night or when the sun is not yet up, or in foggy or bad visibility environments such as tunnels, you HAVE to wear such lights ;
- I got hit by cars a few times in 2016 and 2017, before I had all this protection, and once in 2017 I got hit quite severely by someone, when biking by night with no lights. I was guilty of not having any lights, but he or she was responsable for not seeing me, refusing my priority (I was already in the roundabout), and for leaving me lying (apparently dead) in the middle of said roundabout after hitting me. **As I said above, cars and other motorized vehicles are your deadliest enemies ;**

- **I am extremely careful against any large vehicle such as buses, trucks** etc, as I am aware of **their large blind spots and occasional rude driving habits**. I am very much aware that any such vehicles, and even a car when it goes enough, can kill me in an instant if I'm not careful enough, or if they do any mistake or want to hurt me. I lost a close family member to a car accident while he was cycling in November 2019 ;

- I check my front and back brakes before leaving on my bikes, as well as my tires, and I re-inflate my tires very regularly. I control my chain and brakes and most parts of my bikes myself regularly, and usually once a year (in the summer) I bring my bike to a professional for a quick check-up. It costs less than fixing it *after* an accident, and I like the idea of spending some of my money to support professionals mechanics who chose to work for bikes instead of the evil car industry!

- On one hand, **I do my best in respecting the driving rules when I bike in France, especially regarding red lights, roundabouts and priorities**. I can get very annoyed if a car or another bike or anyone don't follow these rules, especially if your stupid behavior is a danger to myself or others. I had and will continue to actively notify drivers of their bad habits, by talking or shouting or waving at them whenever it is required.
- On the other hand, I tend to consider that bikes should have priority over cars, as they are more ecological and respectful of other people (don't do noise, don't take public space on the street, can't kill you, don't smell bad, etc). Whenever I'm not putting myself in danger and not violating any rules, I act as if bikes indeed had the highest priority over other vehicles (and I defend my right to do so) ;
- I also think bikes should have priority over pedestrians as well. This last remark comes from the main argument that bikes have inertia, while pedestrians dont, so it's globally more energy-preserving to let bikes have priority, whenever it's not a danger to pedestrians. Of course, whenever a pedestrian is already crossing the road (for instance), I'll let her/him pass and I'll stop, but I am thankful for people who are smart enough (or not in a hurry) to do the opposite, and whenever I walk I apply the opposite rule and consider bikes to have priority over me.


Hitch-hiking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Hitch-hiking is the best way to travel while meeting new people, and taking your time and risking randomness ;
- **I am proud to have traveled for free for more than 6000 kilometers using hitch-hiking in France and close Europe** (see `<hitch-hiking.en.html>`_), and I am admire my friends or family members who have done even more (go Fabian!) ;

- **If you drive and you have the time and a free seat in your car, you should take hitch-hiker**. Maybe be more careful if you are alone, or a woman, or if you are afraid of strangers. But I believe in a world where everyone should be nice, hence one should not be scared of strangers, so one should always open their car to hitch-hiker. Statistically, you are far more likely to be attacked, assaulted or even raped by your own family relative or friends, by your partner, or by someone following you in a street, than by a random hitch-hiker. I believe in this number, and most probably you should too ;

- Basically, in my last 12 years of life, about 70% of the times I was in a car was because I did hitch-hiking with pure strangers, 29% because I was in a car with a family member or a friend, who would have traveled even without me, and 1% was in a location vehicle to move between two apartments or in a friend's car I was driving for a personal reason ;


Car-pooling
~~~~~~~~~~~

**TL;DR: if you have to travel but there is no train available for this time or destination, if you have heavy luggage or a precise timing to respect, or if you are afraid of hitch-hiking, then using once in a while a car-pooling is acceptable, and should be preferred over using your own car or renting a car.**

- I like `BlaBlaCar <https://www.blablacar.fr/>`_ in France, but I really prefer hitch-hiking. In fact, BlaBlaCar was free at the beginning, and free alternatives still exist like `<http://covoiturage-libre.fr>`_ but they are not so popular and not many people use them, unfortunately...
- If you can avoid buying a car because a colleague or friend or neighbor can drive you to your workplace or school, that's amazing!
- If you can find a car-pooling solution for your holiday or occasional travel, and if there is no alternative using train (which pollute far less than cars!), then it is acceptable to do so ;
- As for anything else, the most ecological and economical friendly gesture you can make is simply to not travel (like for food or clothing, the best action is to not buy unless necessary!)... so between two choices of taking a car-pooling to go somewhere just for fun, and not going and doing something locally, I will of course always choose to not travel.
