 How to stay in touch with me ?
################################
.. sidebar:: About

   This page's purpose is to give a complete list of different way to stay in touch with `me <index.html>`_ (*Lilian Besson*).

Instantaneous video-conference ?
--------------------------------
1. *First*, reach me by e-mail, so we agree on a date and time to call (*asynchronous*),
2. *Then* we use the awesome and brand new website *FramaTalk*: `FramaTalk.org/Naereen <https://framatalk.org/Naereen>`_ or Jitsi on `<jitsi/>`_ (see `this page on Jitsi <jitsi.en.html>`_) !
3. *Why ?* It does not require any installation or plugin, no need to create any account, no need for a specific software - just your regular web browser (a fairly recent one is needed). And it's awesomely secured, as the conversation and messages are not spied nor registered (the communication uses peer-to-peer trafic with WebRTC, that's safe).
4. Other web services that I like : `<https://services.renater.fr/rendez-vous/index>`_ (by RENATER, for French researchers and teachers), `<https://visio.inria.fr/?lang=fr-FR>`_ (by INRIA), `<https://meet.jit.si/>`_, `<https://www.gruveo.com/>`_, `<https://whereby.com/>`_ (it was appear.in before).


Traditional ways
----------------
Postal addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can write a letter or some postal cards to me (I love them),
at the following addresses (listed by decreasing preference):

.. raw:: html

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.2/dist/leaflet.css" />
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.2/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
   <style type="text/css">
      #office, #home {
         margin:  auto;
         z-index: 0;
         height:  480px;
         width:   900px;
      }
   </style>


My Office
~~~~~~~~~
I don't have an office but I can receive mail at my new institution, at `Centre International de Valbonne <http://www.civfrance.com/>`_, in Valbonne, in France
(see `this OpenStreetMap page <https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/20350865#map=17/48.59496/7.75484>`_) ::

      Dr Lilian Besson
      Classe de MP2I
      Centre International de Valbonne
      BP 97
      06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex (France)
      France

.. raw:: html

   <div id="office"></div>
   <script type="text/javascript">
      var office = L.map("office").setView([43.6211874, 7.0248404], 18);

      L.tileLayer("https://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", {
         attribution: "&copy; <a href='https://osm.org/copyright'>OpenStreetMap</a> contributors"
      }).addTo(office);

      L.marker([43.6211874, 7.0248404]).addTo(office)
         .bindPopup("Dr Lilian Besson<br> Classe de MP2I<br> Centre International de Valbonne<br> BP 97<br> 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex (France)<br>France")
         .openPopup();
   </script>


My Home
~~~~~~~
To my own place (in France), I would have given my address before, but not anymore!
If you are a friend, just ask me :)


Emails
^^^^^^
If you are a *spammer*, go on: jarvis.spam@laposte.net! Oh, and, go kîll yoùrself also if you are a *spammer*!!
(Well… spammers are usually bots, ie spambots, but it feels good to yell at them anyway!)

   :align: right
   :alt:   My email address in a PNG picture…
   :target: mailto:Lilian.Besson at crans dot org


If you are *not* a *spammer*, go on, you can use one of these email addresses:

- `Lilian dot Besson at ac-nice dot fr <mailto:Lilian dot Besson at ac-nice dot fr>`_
- `Lilian dot Besson at ens-rennes dot fr <mailto:Lilian dot Besson at ens-rennes dot fr>`_

.. note::

   You can use `this awesome website <http://send-email.org/>`_ (``send-email.org``)
   if you don't have access to an email client right now.


Regular phone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: .telephone.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: right
   :alt:   My cellphone number, in a PNG picture…
   :target: callto:100101011101001100111101100001_2


To speak directly, e.g. if it is important, you can (try to) call me, you could use my French cellphone number:

.. .. warning:: I am currently out of the French territory, living in XXX (in XXX).

..   Calling someone in a foreign country can be expensive!
..   In fact, even receiving them is costly, so please avoid it (if possible).


You could also try to send me text messages (SMS), with the same number (obviously).

.. (*again, but be aware of the price!*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other methods
-------------
The next solutions are way more *geeky*, and you will need a relatively recent computer to try them (or a smartphone).

*« Ask me anything! »*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These two pages can be used to ask my a question **publically** (everyone can see what you ask and my answer):
on GitHub : `github.com/Naereen/ama <https://github.com/Naereen/ama>`_ (in English),
`github.com/Naereen/ama.fr <https://github.com/Naereen/ama.fr>`_ (in French), both requires a GitHub account;
and on Bitbucket : `bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama>`_ (in English),
`bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama.fr <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama.fr>`_ (in French), no need for an account.

HTML5 Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. sidebar:: Some explanation ?

   You can go to `this testing page <http://iswebrtcready.appear.in/>`_, to check if your browser is compatible with the "WebRTC" technology, which is part of the last HTML version (HTML 5).

   However, these services are *synchronous*, **so first we have to agree for a date and an hour**!


These web services, strongly based on the great functions offered by the `HTML 5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5>`_, offer the possibility to talk, to write or even to share files, dynamically.

* `gruveo.com/#Naereen <https://www.gruveo.com/#Naereen>`_ for vocal or videos calls. It seems to be secured and reliable,
* `framatalk.org/Naereen <https://framatalk.org/Naereen>`_ for video-chat (up to 8 persons at a time), hosted by the `FramaSoft <https://framasoft.org/>`_ non-profit association,
* `whereby.com/Naereen <https://whereby.com/Naereen>`_ for video-chat (up to 8 persons at a time),
* `RTC Copy <https://rtccopy.com/>`_ to securely send files over the Internet (no matter the type, no matter the size).


.. seealso::

   This page `<vieprivee.html>`_ (in French)
      Some others tools are presented there, and they surely can be used to (try to) preserve your on-line private life.
