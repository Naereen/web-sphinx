 How to stay in touch with me ?
################################
.. sidebar:: About

   This page's purpose is to give a complete list of different way to stay in touch with `me <index.html>`_ (*Lilian Besson*).


Traditionnal ways
-----------------
Postal addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can write a letter or some postal cards to me (I love them),
at the following addresses (listed by decreasing preference):

1. The Mathematics department secretary, at *ENS de Cachan*, in France
   (you can `see it on this OpenStreetMap map <http://osm.org/go/0BOchV4ns-->`_) ::

       Mr Lilian Besson,
       ENS de Cachan,
       Dept. de Mathématiques,
       41, avenue du Président Wilson,
       94230 - Cachan,
       France


2. to my place (in France), but this adresse is for private use only.

Emails
^^^^^^
If you are a spammer, go on: jarvis.spam@laposte.net! Oh, and, go fùck yoùrself also.

   :target: mailto:Lilian.Besson at ens-cachan dot fr


If you are not a spammer, go on, you can use this one:

  `Lilian dot Besson at ens-cachan dot fr <mailto:Lilian dot Besson at ens-cachan dot fr>`_


Regular phone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   :target: callto:100101011101001100111101100001_2


To speak directly, but **only if it is really important**, you can try to call me, you could use my French cellphone number:.

.. warning:: I am currently out of the French territory, traveling between Italy, Spain and Switzerland (in Europe).

   Give a call to someone in a foreign country is expensive!
   In fact, even receiving them is costly, so please avoid it if possible.


You could also try to send me text messages (SMS), with the same number, obviously (*again, but be aware of the price!*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other methods
-------------
The next solutions are way more *geeky*, and you will need a relatively recent computer to try them (or a smartphone).

IRC (chat rooms)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From time to time, I appear on the IRC network ``irc.crans.org``, in the rooms *#crans* and *#general*, with pseudo `Naereen <https://gravatar.com/naereen>`_ (I usually use `irssi <http://irssi.org/about>`_ with `these configuration files <publis/irssi/>`_, in a terminal, obviously).

If you are feeling particularly audacious, you can try to "let a message for me" there, *that's really a bad idea*.

VoIP (Telephony by the Internet)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You could follow this `procedure (in French) <https://wiki.crans.org/VieCrans/UtiliserVoIP#A.2BAMo-tre_appel.2BAOk_depuis_l.27ext.2BAOk-rieur>`_ to call me: call the French fix number ``+33.9.72.11.32.70`` then compose "one four zero four two" (``14042``) when the robot asks you to do it.

You could also try to call me (or to text me) at the `Linphone <http://www.linphone.org/>`_ account: naereen at linphone dot org (" at " = "@", " dot " = ".").

.. note:: Linphone ?

   `Linphone`_ is a *free* and *open-source*  voice over IP implementation, which works perfectly.
   They have a desktop application (for Windows, Ubuntu etc) and one for mobile phones (Android etc).
   For Android, I prefer to use the awesome `CSip Simple <http://apk-dl.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple>`_.
   `Linphone`_ also provides free user accounts, to call (without limit) any other `Linphone`_ users, thanks to VoIP and the `SIP protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol>`_.


Forms on some web pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* You can use this very form to send me a message, currently this page is powered by the `electronic people's directory <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/directory/besson-lilian-128786.kjsp>`_ for `ENS Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/>`_ : http://perso.crans.org/besson/contact,
* or if it is related to one of my pages or softwares, you could signal a bug with this form: https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/home/issues/new. But **it is not designed to contact me directly!**

HTML5 Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. sidebar:: Some explanation ?

   You can go to `this testing page <http://iswebrtcready.appear.in/>`_, to check if your browser is compatible with the "WebRTC" technology, which is part of the last HTML version (HTML 5).

   However, these services are *synchronous*, **so first we have to agree for a date and an hour**!


These web services, strongly based on the great functions offered by the `HTML 5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5>`_, offer the possibility to talk, to write or even to share files, dynamically.

* `gruveo.com/#0628412257 <https://www.gruveo.com/#0628412257>`_ for vocal or videos calls. It seems to be secured and reliable,
* `appear.in/Naereen <https://appear.in/Naereen>`_ for video-chat, up to 8 persons at a time,
* `RTC Copy <https://rtccopy.com/>`_ to securely send files over the Internet (no matter the type, no matter the size).

      Some others tools are presented there, and they surely can be used to (try to) preserve your on-line private life.
