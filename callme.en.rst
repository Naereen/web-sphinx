 How to stay in touch with me ?
################################
.. sidebar:: About

   This page's purpose is to give a complete list of different way to stay in touch with `me <index.html>`_ (*Lilian Besson*).

Instantaneous video-conference ?
--------------------------------
1. *First*, reach me by e-mail, so we agree on a date and time to call (*asynchronous*),
2. *Then* we use the awesome and brand new website *FramaTalk*: `framatalk.org/Naereen <https://framatalk.org/Naereen>`_ !
3. *Why ?* It does not require any installation or plugin, no need to create any account, no need for a specific software - just your regular web browser (a fairly recent one is needed). And it's awesomely secured, as the conversation and messages are not spied nor registered (the communication uses peer-to-peer trafic with WebRTC, that's safe).


Traditionnal ways
-----------------
Postal addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can write a letter or some postal cards to me (I love them),
at the following addresses (listed by decreasing preference):

1. The Mathematics department secretary, at *ENS de Cachan*, in France
   (you can `see it on this OpenStreetMap map <http://osm.org/go/0BOchV4ns-->`_) ::

       Mr Lilian Besson,
       ENS de Cachan,
       Dept. de Mathématiques,
       41, avenue du Président Wilson,
       94230 - Cachan,
       France


2. to my own place (in France), I give the address by email if you ask it.

Emails
^^^^^^
If you are a *spammer*, go on: jarvis.spam@laposte.net! Oh, and, go kîll yoùrself also if you are a *spammer*!!
(Well... spammers are usually bots, ie spambots, but it feels good to yell at them anyway!)

   :alt:   My email address in a PNG picture...
   :target: mailto:Lilian.Besson at ens-cachan dot fr


If you are *not* a *spammer*, go on, you can use this one:

  `Lilian dot Besson at ens-cachan dot fr <mailto:Lilian dot Besson at ens-cachan dot fr>`_


Regular phone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: .telephone.png
   :scale: 130 %
   :align: right
   :alt:   My cellphone number, in a PNG picture...
   :target: callto:100101011101001100111101100001_2


To speak directly, e.g. if it is important, you can (try to) call me, you could use my French cellphone number:

.. .. warning:: I am currently out of the French territory, living in Switzerland (in Lausanne).

..   Calling someone in a foreign country can be expensive!
..   In fact, even receiving them is costly, so please avoid it (if possible).


You could also try to send me text messages (SMS), with the same number (obviously).

.. (*again, but be aware of the price!*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other methods
-------------
The next solutions are way more *geeky*, and you will need a relatively recent computer to try them (or a smartphone).

*« Ask me anything! »*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These two pages can be used to ask my a question **publically** (everyone can see what you ask and my answer):
on GitHub : `github.com/Naereen/ama <https://github.com/Naereen/ama>`_,
`github.com/Naereen/ama.fr <https://github.com/Naereen/ama.fr>`_ (requires a GitHub account);
and one Bitbucket `bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama>`_,
`bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama.fr <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ama.fr>`_ (no need for an account).

IRC (chat rooms)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From time to time, I appear on the IRC network ``irc.crans.org``, in the rooms *#crans* and *#general*, with pseudo `Naereen <https://gravatar.com/naereen>`_ (I usually use `irssi <http://irssi.org/about>`_ with `these configuration files <publis/irssi/>`_, in a terminal, obviously).

If you are feeling particularly audacious, you can try to "let a message for me" there, *that's really a bad idea*.

.. VoIP (Telephony by the Internet)
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. You could follow this `procedure (in French) <https://wiki.crans.org/VieCrans/UtiliserVoIP#A.2BAMo-tre_appel.2BAOk_depuis_l.27ext.2BAOk-rieur>`_ to call me: call the French fix number ``+33.9.72.11.32.70`` then compose "one four zero four two" (``14042``) when the robot asks you to do it.

.. You could also try to call me (or to text me) at the `Linphone <http://www.linphone.org/>`_ account: naereen at linphone dot org (" at " = "@", " dot " = ".").

.. .. note:: Linphone ?

..    `Linphone`_ is a *free* and *open-source*  voice over IP implementation, which works perfectly.
..    They have a desktop application (for Windows, Ubuntu etc) and one for mobile phones (Android etc).
..    For Android, I prefer to use the awesome `CSip Simple <http://apk-dl.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple>`_.
..    `Linphone`_ also provides free user accounts, to call (without limit) any other `Linphone`_ users, thanks to VoIP and the `SIP protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol>`_.


Forms on some web pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* You can use this very form to send me a message, currently this page is powered by the `electronic people's directory <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/directory/besson-lilian-128786.kjsp>`_ for `ENS Cachan <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/>`_ : http://perso.crans.org/besson/contact,
* or if it is related to one of my pages or softwares, you could signal a bug with this form: https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/home/issues/new. But **it is not designed to contact me directly!**

HTML5 Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. sidebar:: Some explanation ?

   You can go to `this testing page <http://iswebrtcready.appear.in/>`_, to check if your browser is compatible with the "WebRTC" technology, which is part of the last HTML version (HTML 5).

   However, these services are *synchronous*, **so first we have to agree for a date and an hour**!


These web services, strongly based on the great functions offered by the `HTML 5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5>`_, offer the possibility to talk, to write or even to share files, dynamically.

* `gruveo.com/#Naereen <https://www.gruveo.com/#Naereen>`_ for vocal or videos calls. It seems to be secured and reliable,
* `framatalk.org/Naereen <https://framatalk.org/Naereen>`_ for video-chat (up to 8 persons at a time), hosted by the `FramaSoft <https://framasoft.org/>`_ non-profit association,
* `appear.in/Naereen <https://appear.in/Naereen>`_ for video-chat (up to 8 persons at a time),
* `RTC Copy <https://rtccopy.com/>`_ to securely send files over the Internet (no matter the type, no matter the size).

   This page `<vieprivee.html>`_ (in French)
      Some others tools are presented there, and they surely can be used to (try to) preserve your on-line private life.
