.. .. todo:: find a way to restrict the inclusion when generating HTML via Sphinx.

.. only:: html

   .. note:: Sphinx and reStructuredTex

      Those web pages are generated with the *tool* **Sphinx**, from ``reStructuredText`` source files.
      Remark, bug issues, or question can be asked on `this page <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/issues>`_.
      Precision about copyrights, quoted trademarks and institutions are available `on this page <trademarks.html>`_.

   .. warning:: Javascript and Google Analytics Â®

      I'm using ``Javascript``, and some Django *templating* to integrate **Google Analytics** on those pages.
      To disable those tools, you just need to disable Javascript, 
      probably with the preferences menu of your browser.
