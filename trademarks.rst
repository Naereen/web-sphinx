 Precision about the quoted **trademarks**
###########################################


This page is written to clarify some *« legal »* points regarding my webpages.

.. warning:: This page is old and :red:`NOT UP-TO-DATE` at all!

.. todo:: Keep it up-to-date!

About
-----
 This little page is intented to quote the trademarks I quote
 in the other pages. And also to give an almost exhaustive
 list of the software and usefull website I'm using for my projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutions
------------
 I'm trying to keep a list of all quoted institution,
 and to clarify here the one which I am connected to
 and the others.

ENS de Cachan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Just to precise : I am a **student** at ENS de Cachan.
 Not a teacher, not anything else than a student.

 But it could be a source of misunderstanding : I am a student, ok,
 but with the *special* French status ``normalien``.

 That means that I'm affiliated with the French *'Enseignement Supérieur'*
 minister, and I receives a salary for this.

 I entered to this school by passing a national exam, in 2011.

 .. note::

    So, when I quote 'ENS de Cachan', in my pages or in my source codes,
    that **always** means that I'm a student,
    and also that a significant part of my work is **related** to the work
    “I have to do *at school*”.

CMLA (Maths research institute)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The CMLA is the Mathematics research institute of ENS de Cachan.

 Again, I am **not** a member of the CMLA. At least, a lot of
 the maths teachers I heard during the past two years are related to the CMLA,
 but nothing else.

 .. note::

    So, when I quote 'CMLA', in my pages or in my source codes,
    that **never** means that I'm a member of CMLA,
    but that means a part of this content is related to the work
    “I have to do *at school*”.

LSV (*CS* research institute)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The LSV is the Computer Science lab research of ENS de Cachan.

 Again, I am **not** a member of the LSV. At least, a lot of
 the CS teachers I heard in the last two years are related to the LSV,
 but nothing else.

 .. note::

    So, when I quote 'LSV', in my pages or in my source codes,
    that **never** means that I'm a member of LSV,
    but that a part of the content is related to the work
    “I have to do *at school*”.

CNRS (French scientific research institute)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The CNRS is the French Institude for Scientific Research
 ("Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique").

 I have no connection to the CNRS. Not at all.

 Anyway, I used their name and their logo for a few months,
 on a few pages.
 **For this, I sincerely appologize** : I will no longer do such a thing.

 .. note::

    I'm trying to clean up some of my old codes,
    and my old web pages, to erase all occurrences
    of the CNRS name or logo.
    If you find of I forgot to erase, please inform me.
