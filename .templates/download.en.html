<h2>Download these pages in PDFF</h2>
 <p>These web pages are generated with <strong>Sphinx</strong>.
And when I generate them, one of my script use rst2pdf to also produce a PDF version of each HTML pages.</p>
 <p>The folder <a href="{{ pathto('pdf/', true)|e }}" title="pdf/ folder" >pdf/</a> is there to download
some PDF files produced that way.</p>
 <p>This is already functionnal, but some pages are useless without JavaScript (not yet integrated in the PDF documents, but it might be possible).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Download folder</h2>
 <p>The folder <a href="dl/">dl/</a> is there to download backup archives of somes projects.</p>
 <p>This folder is protected by a username and a password.
  It is possible to ask for one by email, if needed, to
  <a href="mailto:naereen[@]crans[.]org?subject=[web-sphinx]">naereen[@]crans[.]org</a>.</p>
