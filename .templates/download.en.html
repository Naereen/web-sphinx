<h2>Download these pages in PDF</h2>
 <p>These web pages are generated with <strong>Sphinx</strong>.
And when I generate them, one of my script use rst2pdf to also produce a PDF version of each HTML pages.</p>
 <p>The folder <a href="{{ pathto('pdf/', true)|e }}" title="pdf/ folder" >pdf/</a> is there to download
some PDF files produced that way.</p>
 <p>This is already functionnal, but some pages are useless without JavaScript (not yet integrated in the PDF documents, but it might be possible).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Download folder</h2>
 <p>The folder <a href="dl/">dl/</a> is there to download backup archives of somes projects.</p>
 <p>This folder is protected by a username and a password.
  It is possible to ask for one by email, if needed, to
  <a href="mailto:naereen[@]crans[.]org?subject=[web-sphinx]">naereen[@]crans[.]org</a>.</p>
<h2>Sources for this site</h2>
 <h3>"Static" content : rST files</h3>
   The git repository <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/">lbesson/web-sphinx</a> hosts rST files,
   Jinja templates, and many others ressources required to generate these web pages with <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org">sphinx</a>.
  </br>
   This site is an open-source and a free software project.
   A zip archive can be downloaded with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx/get/master.zip">this link</a>.
 <h3>"Dynamical" content : JavaScript files</h3>
   The git repository <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx-scripts/">lbesson/web-sphinx-scripts</a> hosts JavaScript files,
   required by these web pages to be fully functional.
  </br>
   These scripts are written by me, or are from other open-source projects.
   I think every used project is freely distributed under a license free nice enough to "allow me" to include them in my repository,
   which can be downloaded with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/web-sphinx-scripts/get/master.zip">this zip archive</a>.
