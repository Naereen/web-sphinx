Some lists of applications
--------------------------
 There are a few lists of some useful apps, kinda sorted by category.

.. note:: What's an application ?

   An application (*app*) is a program for a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone powered by the exploitation systeme Android.

   These programs are distributed as compressed archives,
   with the ``apk`` format, which means "*Application PacKage*",
   as the *EXEcutable* program for Windows with the ``.exe`` format,
   or the *Disk iMaGe* for Mac OS X with the ``.dmg`` format.

How to use Android **without** a Google account
-----------------------------------------------
Other repos
^^^^^^^^^^^
Among many apps repositories, my favorite is `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org/about/>`_,
mainly because it's completely free and focused only on Open Source apps.

For instance, there is `the page for AFWall+ <https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=firewall&fdid=dev.ukanth.ufirewall>`_, the best `firewall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_firewall>`_ on Android.

Direct download
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`apk-dl.com <http://apk-dl.com/>`_ is a wonderful website,
designed to simply download apps from the `official Google Play repository <https://play.google.com/store/apps/>`_
without having to log in with a Google account.

For instance, there is `a direct link for Jota Text Editor <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.sblo.pandora.jota>`_
(one of the best text editors on Android, for which I designed the `syntactic coloration <NanoSyntax.html#autres-references>`_ configuration files for ``OCaml`` and ``rST`` !).
