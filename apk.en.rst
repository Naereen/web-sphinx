 Android‚Ñ¢ applications "for the confinement" in 2020
#####################################################


The list of applications given here corresponds to the applications I have installed on my (two) Android‚Ñ¢ smartphones in 2020, and that I opened and used every day during the `coronavirus containment` (at least one month).

I list them by categories, following the categories already used on my phones.


.. note:: This page is about applications for Android‚Ñ¢

- FM radio: to listen (with headphones);
- `YouTube <https://www.YouTube.com/>`_ of course;
- `YouTube Music <https://music.YouTube.com/>`_: to listen to unlimited music in streaming (with a subscription, at 10‚Ç¨ per month, and free one to four months);
- Tape recorder: to record sound with your phone in one click. Very handy to record a bird and try to find its name after (e.g., a chicken) ;
- `Duolingo <https://www.DuoLingo.com/>`_ : to learn another language! In confinement, nothing like 20 minutes every day to learn Portuguese, for example!
- CM (Classic Music) : hundreds of free classical music pieces that can be listened to in one click (in streaming).


Useful apps
~~~~~~~~~~~

   :target: https://www.WordPress.com/


To use websites easily on mobile (registered account, easy to use) :

- `WordPress <https://www.WordPress.com/>`_ : to manage a blog under WordPress, e.g., `Actuel Moyen-√Çge <https://ActuelMoyenAge.WordPress.com/>`_ ;
- `LeMonde <https://www.LeMonde.fr/>`_ for current events (in France). I think it is essential to read the news quickly in the morning on AT LEAST ONE digital newspaper.

.. sidebar:: Other languages?

   I also read `The Times <https://www.times.co.uk/>`_, `The NY Times <https://www.nytimes.com/>`_, `The Guardian <https://www.TheGuardian.com/>`_ and `El Pais <https://www.ElPais.com/>`_ in Spanish.


- `Doctolib <https://www.Doctolib.fr/>`_ to make an appointment with one's health practitioners (doctor, dentist, etc);

Three tiny applications, just to access a phone sensor:

- **Barometer**: with the help of the Internet, and the possible internal sensor, gives the current pressure (useful for predicting the weather);
- **Sonometer**: current volume, very well done!
- **Pedometer**: any good application will do it. If you have a "connected watch" it can talk to the application!

And finally:

- Your favorite app that offers a **VPN** (e.g., **NordVPN**);
- Your favorite weather app;
- `Language <https://www.Linguee.com/>`_: online dictionary.


.. sidebar:: What is an application?

   An application (*app*) is a program for a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone powered by the **Android‚Ñ¢** OS.

   These programs are distributed as compressed archives,
   with the ``apk`` format, which means "*Application PacKage*",
   as the *EXEcutable* program for **Windows‚Ñ¢** with the ``.exe`` format,
   or the *Disk iMaGe* for **Mac OS X‚Ñ¢** with the ``.dmg`` format.


To (not) travel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: List of apps related to travel
   :target: https://www.Trainline.fr/


To use websites easily on mobile (registered account, easy to use) :

- `Trainline EU <https://www.Trainline.fr/>`_ to book and pay (and keep) train tickets. Now works in the (western) half of Europe!
- `(Google) Maps <https://maps.Google.com/>`_ to calculate routes and locate yourself. I also suggest Waze for car routes.

.. sidebar:: An open-source, free alternative to Google Maps ?

   In addition to being free and open source, `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ is created and managed by the community.
   With `OSM And <https://osmand.net/>`_ you can download maps in advance and access them easily without an internet connection.


- `Rome2rio <https://www.Rome2rio.com/>`_ to calculate routes that mix train, car, plane, etc.. Very reliable, very efficient everywhere in Europe, I don't know about the rest of the world. In France, it knows bus and train timetables better than Google Maps!
- `BlaBlaCar <https://www.BlaBlaCar.fr/>`_ to book and manage his carpool trips with the most popular platform in France (several million users) ;
- `Booking.com <https://www.Booking.com/>`_ to book accommodation, whether rental apartments (like AirBNB), hotels, etc. If you want to become a customer, use this link : FIXME.

- **Calm**: to help daily meditation, and offers free ambient sounds like forest or birds;
- **Forest**: to help disconnect from your phone;
- **Drink Water Reminder**: super simple but effective;
- **Sleep Monitor**: suggests to go to sleep in the evening, effective alarm (soft but persistent) in the morning... The app also offers very precise statistics, if you think about indicating the beginning and end of sleep ;
- Bonus: the website `Generative.fm <https://Generative.fm/>`_ offers dozens of pieces of background music, random, composed by... programs (neural networks and everything)! It's ideal for work, I love it !

Two very similar applications, which propose in large cities to recover lunch baskets or other that will be thrown away:

- **Phoenix App**;
- **TooGoodToGo**.

Other apps :

- **OpenFoodFacts** gives a lot of curious information about all kinds of food products;
- **Season** to know the fruits and vegetables in season;
- **Pumpkin** to pay his friends, I use it because it is used by the association at the ENS in Rennes which manages the AMAP.
