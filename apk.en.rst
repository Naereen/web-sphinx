 Android™ applications "for the confinement" in 2020
#####################################################


The list of applications given here corresponds to the applications I have installed on my (two) Android™ smartphones in 2020, and that I opened and used every day during the `coronavirus containment` (at least one month).

.. todo:: This was translated using `DeepL <https://www.DeepL.com/>`_, so I need to proof-read it, and update if needed.

I list them by categories, following the categories already used on my phones.

- `Facebook lite <https://www.Facebook.com/>`_ (*lite* version which is more than enough);
- `WhatsApp <https://www.WhatsApp.com/>`_;

- `CouchSurfing <https://www.CouchSurfing.com/>`_: I use it to lodge people in my home, and to get people to lodge me in other people's homes, when I travel;
- SnapChat : to play spy with your friends;
- `OkCupid <https://www.OkCupid.com/>`_: not many people, but smart, nice people;
- `Tinder <https://www.Tinder.com/>`_: there are a lot of people, and few people who respond to conversations afterwards;
- `Happn <https://www.Happn.com/>`_: I don't really like it, there are a lot of people, but nobody answers;
- `Once <https://www.Once.com/>`_: I really don't like it.


...sidebar:: Might be out of date!

   I wrote this list in *April 2020*, so it might  be obsolete...

- FM radio: to listen (with headphones) ;
- `YouTube <https://www.YouTube.com/>`Evidently;
- `YouTube Music <https://music.YouTube.com/>`_: to listen to unlimited music in streaming (with a subscription, at 10€ per month, and free one to four months);
- Tape recorder: to record sound with your phone in one click. Very handy to record a bird and try to find its name after (e.g., a chicken) ;
- `Duolingo <https://www.DuoLingo.com/>`_ : to learn another language! In confinement, nothing like 20 minutes every day to learn Portuguese, for example!
- CM (Classic Music) : hundreds of free classical music pieces that can be listened to in one click (in streaming).


Useful apps
~~~~~~~~~~~

   :target: https://www.WordPress.com/



To use websites easily on mobile (registered account, easy to use) :

- `WordPress <https://www.WordPress.com/>`_ : to manage a blog under WordPress (e.g., `Actual Middle Ages <https://ActuelMoyenAge.WordPress.com/>`_, `Rennes en Résilience <https://RennesenResilience.WordPress.com/>`_);
- `TheWorld <https://www.LeMonde.fr/>`_ for current events. I think it is essential to read the news quickly in the morning on AT LEAST ONE digital newspaper;
- `Doctolib <https://www.Doctolib.fr/>` to make an appointment with one's health practitioners (doctor, dentist, etc);

Three tiny applications, just to access a phone sensor:

- **Barometer**: with the help of the Internet, and the possible internal sensor, gives the current pressure (useful for predicting the weather);
- **Sonometer**: current volume, very well done!
- **Pedometer**: any good application will do it. If you have a "connected watch" it can talk to the application!

And finally:

- Your favorite app that offers a **VPN** (e.g., **NordVPN**);
- Your favorite weather app;
- `Language <https://www.Linguee.com/>`_: online dictionary.


.. sidebar:: What is an application?

   An application (*app*) is a program for a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone powered by the **Android™** OS.

   These programs are distributed as compressed archives,
   with the ``apk`` format, which means "*Application PacKage*",
   as the *EXEcutable* program for **Windows™** with the ``.exe`` format,
   or the *Disk iMaGe* for **Mac OS X™** with the ``.dmg`` format.



To (not) travel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: List of apps related to travel
   :target: https://www.Trainline.fr/



To use websites easily on mobile (registered account, easy to use) :

- `Trainline EU <https://www.Trainline.fr/>`_ to book and pay (and keep) train tickets. Now works in the (western) half of Europe!
- `(Google) Maps <https://maps.Google.com/>`_ to calculate routes and locate yourself. I also suggest Waze for car routes.

... sidebar:: A free, free alternative to Google Maps ?

   In addition to being free and open source, `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ is created and managed by the community.
   With `OSM And <https://osmand.net/>`_ you can download maps in advance and access them easily without an internet connection.

- `Rome2rio <https://www.Rome2rio.com/>`_ to calculate routes that mix train, car, plane, etc.. Very reliable, very efficient everywhere in Europe, I don't know about the rest of the world. In France, it knows bus and train timetables better than Google Maps!
- `BlaBlaCar <https://www.BlaBlaCar.fr/>`_ to book and manage his carpool trips with the most popular platform in France (several million users) ;
- `Booking.com <https://www.Booking.com/>`_ to book accommodation, whether rental apartments (like AirBNB), hotels, etc. If you want to become a customer, use this link : FIXME.

Two very similar applications, which propose in large cities to recover lunch baskets or other that will be thrown away:

- **Phoenix App**;
- **TooGoodToGo**.

Other apps :

- **OpenFoodFacts** gives a lot of curious information about all kinds of food products;
- **Season** to know the fruits and vegetables in season;
- **Pumpkin** to pay his friends, I use it because it is used by the association at the ENS in Rennes which manages the AMAP.
