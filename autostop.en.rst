 About hitch-hiking
####################
.. include:: .special.rst

This page is a short presentation of my personal experience
on the matter of hitch-hiking, and why it is a really cool, free and culturally interesting way to travel.

Maybe I will include here a list of epic hitch-hiking achievements, maybe not.

.. note:: With Google Maps ?

   I know that Google Maps can be used to save and share custom car *itineraries* (travel history),
   maybe I will use that to keep a trace of my hitch-hiking trips and
   share them here. Or maybe not.


A quick overview
----------------
In 2015
^^^^^^^
Not yet! But I do plan two long hitch-hiking trip during the summer of 2015.

Briançon (France) - Paris (France) by Italy (Turin, Venice, Padua), in 2 weeks:

.. digraph:: voyage1

   "Briançon (France)" -> "Italy" -> "Switzerland" -> "Jura (France)" -> "Paris (France)";


And then another one, slightly more ambitious, from Paris to Novrway en 3 semaines:

.. digraph:: voyage2

   "Paris" -> "Bruxelles (Belgium)" -> "Amsterdam (Netherlands)" -> "Danemark" -> "Sweden" -> "Norway" -> "(and back!)";


In 2014
^^^^^^^
About 150 kms, half a dozen of times, around Paris, and a very little bit near Hyderabad, in India.

In 2013
^^^^^^^
Something like 1800 kms (for American *ignorants*, go `check on Wikipédia what kilometers are <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometers>`_), and only in France, in the "Landes" and "Normandie" regions.

In 2012
^^^^^^^
Less than 300 kms, mainly in *Corsica* and the *Côte-d'Azur*.

Before 2012
^^^^^^^^^^^
A very little bit, well I was not 18 at the time...

(External) Hitch-Hiking guide to...
-----------------------------------
Some Hitch-Hiking guide to the Hitch-Hiker (of the road, not H2G2) !

If hitch-hiking seems interesting for you, I recommend these web-pages:

  - `The hitch-hiking guide on the WikiTravel.org project <http://wikitravel.org/en/Hitchhiking>`_, and `some specific advises for Europe <http://wikitravel.org/fr/Auto-stop_en_Europe>`_

Some websites are specialized about hitch-hiking:

  - `HitchWiki.org/en/ <http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page>`_ is a Wiki project only designed to provide help about hitch-hiking!

Some informal statistics
------------------------
A few remarks about the nice drivers who are willing to take hitch-hikers :

* more men than women,
* alone people more than people with children,
* usually, they also practice hitch-hiking on their own, or they have practiced it before,
* not really able to notice any pattern in their age,
* usually they are locals (living near the start point or the destination).
