 About hitch-hiking
####################
.. include:: .special.rst
.. warning:: Still in progress !

This page is a short presentation of my personal experience
on the matter of hitch-hiking, and why it is a really cool, free and culturally interesting way to travel.

Maybe I will include here a list of epic hitch-hiking achievements, maybe not.

.. note:: With Google Maps ?

   I know that Google Maps can be used to save and share custom car *itineraries* (travel history),
   maybe I will use that to keep a trace of my hitch-hiking trips and
   share them here. Or maybe not.


A quick overview
----------------
In 2014
^^^^^^^
Less than 200kms, around Paris and Hyderabad, in India.

In 2013
^^^^^^^
Something like 1800 kms (for american *ignorants*, go check on Wikipedia what kilometers are), and only in France, in the "Landes" and "Normandie" regions.

In 2012
^^^^^^^
Less than 300kms, mainly in *Corsica* and the *Côte-d'Azur*.

Some informal statistics
------------------------
A few remarks about the nice drivers who are willing to take hitch-hikers :

* more men than women,
* alone people more than people with children,
* usually, they also practice hitch-hiking on their own, or they have practiced it before,
* not really able to notice any pattern in their age,
* usually they are locals (living near the start point or the destination).
