 My favorite Firefox extensions
################################
.. include:: .special.rst
.. note:: This page is about Firefox extensions

   For more details, maybe you should first read one of these:

    * for instance the `official Firefox extensions repository <https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/>`_,
    * or on Wikipedia: `Extension (Mozilla) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(Mozilla)>`_.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some lists of extensions
------------------------
 There are a few lists of some useful extensions, kinda sorted by category.

.. note:: What is an extension?

   An extension is an additional piece of program a for your browser.
   I am focusing on the wonderful `Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>`_ here.

   These extensions are somewhat similar to `Sublime Text plugins <https://packagecontrol.io/>`_, so if you are interested: `I wrote a page about Sublime Text <sublimetext.en.html>`_ too!

.. warning:: Might be out-of-date!

   This list was written in *October 2015*, so now it might be a little bit out-of-date...


Extensions *everyone* should have
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `AdBlock Plus <https://adblockplus.org/>`_ to completely remove advertising, pop-ups and other vicious things,
* `InlineDisposition <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/inline-dispotiion/>`_ and `Open In Browser <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/open-in-browser>`_ to *always* be able to open a document in the browser, instead of downloading it,
* `NoSquint <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/nosquint>`_ allows to set the *zoom* and *text zoom* settings differently for each websites (just try it, it's awesome),
* `Speed Tweaks (Speedy Fox) <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/speed-tweaks-speedyfox>`_ to tweak some parameters of Firefox and improve its speed (just one click to do, it works wonderfully out-of-the-box),
* `Tab Mix Plus <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus>`_ adds many useful features if you like to use tabs.


.. note:: « What about `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome>`_? »

   I have never used another browser than Firefox, sorry...

   However, it should be easy for you to look for in the `Google Chrome extensions store <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=fr>`_ to find extensions similar to the one presented here.


Styling extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `FabTabs <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fabtabs>`_ colors each tabs with a color representing its page (a Facebook tab will look blue for instance). Simple but awesome!
* `FlagFox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/flagfox>`_ adds a small flag of the country of the website (domain name but also hosting server),
* `GNotifier <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/gnotifier>`_ and `Tab Notifier <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-notifier>`_ to integrate the browser notifications into the notification system of your desktop (and to display notifications for some pages that should do it but don't. For example it monitors any change of the page title for example, it works on Facebook, YouTube etc),
* `Location Bar Enhancer <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/location-bar-enhancer>`_ adds feature rich breadcrumb user interface in the location bar (weird at first, magical after),
* `New Tab Tools <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/>`_ greatly improves the *"new tab"* page,
* `Tab Wheel Scroll <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-wheel-scrool>`_ to change tabs with the wheel (I don't use it but it is a nice feature).

Extensions for *geeks*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Classic Theme Restorer <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/classic-theme-restorer>`_ allows to disable some of the new Firefox theme features. This add-on restores squared tabs, the application button with application menu (known from Firefox for Windows), the add-on bar, bookmarks/history menu/sidebar buttons and other buttons,
* `Customizable Shortcuts <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/customizable-shortcuts>`_ allows to customize every single Firefox shortcut (I just use it to disable ``Ctrl+q`` and ``Ctrl+Q``... I don't want Firefox to quit without asking me with just a small shortcut!),
* `Download Status Bar <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/download-status-bar>`_ adds nice feature for a better control of the downloading feature in Firefox,
* `Stylish <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish>`_ lets you easily manage user styles: `user styles <https://userstyles.org>`_ are themes for web sites. I am a huge fan of the sweet `github-dark <https://userstyles.org/styles/37035/github-dark>`_ custom style for `GitHub <https://github.com>`_. See also `my style for live.com and outlook.com <publis/firefox/stylish_better_outlook.css>`_ (Outlook Microsoft webmail).
* `Textarea cache <https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/textarea-cache>`_ will save automatically the content in textarea or *"WYSIWYG"* editor when you are typing. Then you can recover the saved texts in the cache window, even if the tab or the window was closed unexpectedly.

Read and view more types of files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Epub Reader <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/epubreader>`_ to read `EPUB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB>`_ files in Firefox (e-books),
* `FireFTP <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fireftp>`_ brings some awesome `FTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP>`_ and `SFTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_file_transfer_program>`_ features to Firefox,
* `FireSSH <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firessh>`_ brings `SSH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH>`_ to Firefox,
* `JavaScript View <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/javascript-view>`_ to nicely display `JavaScript <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_ files in Firefox,
* `JSONView <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview>`_ to nicely display `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ files in Firefox,
* `Markdown Viewer <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer>`_ to nicely display `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ files in Firefox,
* `Wikiwand: Wikipedia Modernized <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wikiwand-wikipedia-modernized>`_ improves the ergonomy for `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/>`_.

Extensions for secrets agents (or paranoid people)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `BetterPrivacy <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/better-privacy>`_ removes useless cookies and Flash cache when closing,
* `Disconnect <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/disconnect>`_ removes trackers and advertising,
* `Element Hiding Helper for AdBlock Plus <https://adblockplus.org/en/elemhidehelper>`_ to be able to remove *any type* of web element (image, banner etc) like if it was an advertising handled by AdBlock,
* `Facebook Disconnect <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/facebook-disconnect>`_ to completely disable Facebook's default tracking behavior on other websites,
* `FlashBlock <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/flashblock>`_ disables by default Flash objects on every page (*note:* AdBlock or Ghostery offer the same feature). No more auto-played videos...
* `Ghostery <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/ghostery>`_ is THE user-friendly tool to disable tracking cookies, tracking beacons and other mini spying softwares that are nowadays on every website (and I have nothing to about it: *this* website `alse uses Google Analytics <ga.en.html>`_...)
* `NoScript Security Suite <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/noscript>`_ is THE less-user-friendly tool to significantly improve security in Firefox: by default, *all unknown* ``javascript`` programs will be disabled (and many other improvements like XSS checks etc),
* `Toggle Proxy <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/toggle-proxy-51740>`_ if you use different proxies.

Extensions for web-developpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Link Checker <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/link-checker/>`_ to... quickly check links!
* `Quick Locale Switcher <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/quick-locale-switcher>`_ to... quickly change the ``locale`` settings (the language you ask the pages to be displayed),
* `Reload Plus <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/reload-plus>`_ to regain control of your cache (``Ctrl+F5`` reload the page, erasing the local cached version).

.. FIXME Dunno how to explain this one.

Other extensions

* `Markdown Here <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/markdown-here/>`_ if you want to write fancy emails with Markdown,
* `Mind the Time <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/mind-the-time/>`_ allows to to precisely monitor the time you send on the web, each day, week and month, website by website.
