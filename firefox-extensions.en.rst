 My favorite Firefox extensions

.. include:: .special.rst
.. note:: This page is about Firefox extensions

   For more details, maybe you should first read one of these:

    * for instance the `official extension repository <https://addons.mozilla.org/>`_,
    * or on on Wikipedia `Extension (Mozilla) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(Mozilla)>`_.

Some lists of extensions
--------------------------
 There are a few lists of some useful extensions, kinda sorted by category.

.. note:: What is an extension?

   An extension is an additional piece of program a for your browser.
   I am focusing on the wonderful `Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>`_ here.

.. warning:: Might be out-of-date!

   This list was written in *October 2015*, so now it might be a little bit out-of-date.


Apps everyone should have
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: « What about Google Chrome ? »

   I have never used another browser than Firefox, sorry.

   However, it should be easy for you to look for in the `Google Chrome extensions store <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=fr>`_ to find extensions similar to the one presented here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Conclude the lists, find other lists to do!
.. todo:: Add links to the official extension repository for each extensions!
