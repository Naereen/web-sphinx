 Some free alternatives software to MatLab

.. seealso:: `This page about Octave <online-gnu-octave.en.html>`_.

`MATLAB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB>`_ is great, but not free and not open-source.
You might be interested by `Free and Open-Source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software>`_ clones of MATLAB or MATLAB-like softwares.

List of alternative software for MatLab
---------------------------------------

1. GNU Octave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`GNU Octave <https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>`_ aims to be a full clone of MATLAB, and has been developped for the last 25 years.
It works really well, and `now has a builtin GUI <http://octave.org/NEWS-4.0.html>`_, very similar to the MATLAB one.

2. SciLab
~~~~~~~~~
`SciLab <https://www.scilab.org/scilab/about>`_, was originally developped by a French team, joint work of CNRS and Inria.
It has a syntax very close to the MATLAB/Octave one, and is still actively developped.

3. SAGE (Python SageMath)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
More details on their website: `SageMath.org <http://www.sagemath.org/tour.html>`_.

4. Python with scientific tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python with the `Spyder IDE <https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/>`_ (with `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_), the `NumPy/SciPy packages <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for computations and `MatPlotLib for plotting <http://matplotlib.org/>`_.

All this is included in the free `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ installer, which allow to install everything in two clicks (one huge file of 400 MB, free to download of course).

.. seealso:: More `details on how to start learning and using Python <learn-python.en.html>`_ on this website.

.. note:: Freeware?

   Each of the mentionned softwares are freely available, on Windows, most of the Linux distributions, or Mac OS.
