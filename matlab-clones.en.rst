 Some free alternatives software to MATLAB
###########################################
.. seealso:: `This other page about GNU Octave <online-gnu-octave.en.html>`_.

`MATLAB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB>`_ is great, but not free and not open-source.

You might be interested by `Free and Open-Source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software>`_ clones of MATLAB or MATLAB-like softwares?
This page is here for this.

List of alternative softwares for MATLAB
----------------------------------------

1. **GNU Octave**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`GNU Octave <https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>`_ aims to be a full clone of MATLAB, and has been developed for the last 25 years.
It works really well, and `now has a built-in GUI <http://octave.org/NEWS-4.0.html>`_, very similar to the MATLAB one.

2. SciLab
~~~~~~~~~
`SciLab <https://www.scilab.org/scilab/about>`_, was originally developed by a French team, joint work of CNRS and INRIA.
It has a syntax very close to the MATLAB and Octave one, and is still actively developed.

3. SAGE (Python SageMath)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
More details on their website: `SageMath.org <http://www.sagemath.org/tour.html>`_.

4. Python with scientific tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python with the `Spyder IDE <https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/>`_ (with `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_), the `NumPy/SciPy packages <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for computations and `MatPlotLib for plotting <http://matplotlib.org/>`_.

All this is included in the free `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ installer, which allow to install everything in two clicks (one huge file of 400 MB, free to download of course).

.. seealso:: More `details on how to start learning and using Python <learn-python.en.html>`_ on this website.

.. note:: "*Freeware*"?

   Each of the mentioned softwares are freely available, on Windows, most of the Linux distributions, or Mac OS.
