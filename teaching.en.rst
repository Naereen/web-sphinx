In 2015
-------
Second semester of 2015
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Nothing yet, though I plan to work at *Lycée Louis-le-Grand* (very prestigious high-school in Paris, for scientific prep-school), to be in charge of regular oral exam in Maths, and CS programming Lab.
 *(this still has to be confirmed)*.

First semester of 2015
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `CS101 @ MEC <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/portal/course/info.php?id=27>`_: in charge of the CS labs (practical sessions) and in charge of certain lectures!
  It represents 4 hours a week of CS labs, during 17 weeks, and 4 hours a week of lectures for 5 weeks (lecture in an amphitheater of 115 students!).
  The slides for some of my lectures for the CS101 course at MEC are here:
   
  1. *"About data-structures in Python (lists, sets, dictionaries)"*: `slides_CS101_part3.pdf <./publis/slides_CS101_part3.pdf>`_,
  2. *"Then, about the use of files in Python (open, read from and write to a file)"*: `slides_CS101_part5_1.pdf <./publis/slides_CS101_part5_1.pdf>`_,
  3. *"And finally an introduction to scientific plotting in Python with MatPlotLib"*: `slides_CS101_part5_2. <./publis/slides_CS101_part5_2.pdf>`_.

:Projects: In April 2015, we gave to our students a programing project, and my teams had two projects: one about matrices and linear algebra operations (→ `mec-cs101-matrices.rtfd.org <http://mec-cs101-matrices.readthedocs.org/en/latest/matrix.html>`_) and one about numerical integration techniques (→ `mec-cs101-integrals.rtfd.org <http://mec-cs101-integrals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/integrals.html>`_). I wrote the complete solutions for these two projects, in Python, and they are hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://www.readthedocs.org>`_.

:Examples: This `new git repository <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/python-demos/commits/>`_ (`python-demos <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/python-demos/>`_) now hosts about 50 examples of Python programs, involving various domains (such as image processing, scientific plotting, numerical or symbolical calculus, machine learning, linear algebra etc). These examples were and are here to illustrate what I covered during my lectures, in March and April 2015.

- `MA102 @ MEC <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/portal/course/info.php?id=22>`_: in charge of one group for Maths tutorials (linear algebra and multi-variable calculus).

.. todo:: More details, and external/internal links (Moodle, slides, etc).

- I am also at the origin of an initiative to help our MEC students by giving them `lists of things to read or work on during the 2015 summer <https://mec-summer-15.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ (*work in progress*).

:Total: For the first semester of 2015, I evaluate my teaching load to be **about 140 hours** (number of hours teaching in front of a group or an amphitheater of students).

In 2014
-------
Second semester of 2014
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `MA101 @ MEC <http://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/portal/course/info.php?id=12>`_ (July - December 2014). In charge of 3 groups (out of 8) for Maths tutorials (introduction to calculus and logical thinking). 6 hours weekly, during 17 weeks (~ 102 hours).

.. todo:: More details, and external/internal links (Moodle, slides, etc).

:Total: For the second semester of 2014, I evaluated my teaching load to be **about 110 hours** (number of hours teaching in front of a group or an amphitheater of students).

:Examens: I was also in charge of the exam papers for Maths and CS: conceive them, merge the ideas from the colleagues, then write everything (in :math:`\LaTeX2e{}` of course), and write a complete and detailed solution, grade myself some of the papers and also overlook the grading done by my colleagues... With a total number of 9 exams (3 for MA101, 3 for CS101, 3 for MA102: *1st* and *2nd* *Mid-Term,* and *Final*), and about a dozen of quiz papers and lab exams, I became quite skilled at this kind of things.

First semester of 2014
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Regularly grading exam answer scripts @ `corrections-rue-ulm <http://www.ulm-corrections.fr/>`_ (exam answer scripts of high-school students, in mathematics).
- Occasionally helping high-school students and in charge of oral exams (at the level of Baccalauréat).

.. note:: In 2014

   I also got admitted to the French national competitive exam for becoming a prep' school professor (*agrégation*) in mathematics (major in maths, minor in CS).

   For the two scholar years 2014-15 and 2015-16, I decided to postpone the beginning of my carrier as a professor in the French secondary education, in order to properly conclude my training at `École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS of Cachan) <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/>`_ (thanks to the choice "*fin de scolarité normalienne*").

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between 2009 and 2013
---------------------
 Nothing serious, but I used to regularly help my friends for Chemistry, Engineering, Physics (2009-2011), and Maths and Computer Science of course (2009-2014).

Before 2009 (high-school and before)
------------------------------------
 I used to regularly help my friends for Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, but also theater.
