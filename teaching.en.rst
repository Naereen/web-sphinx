Second semester of 2015 (in France)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Between September 2015 and March 2016, I was teaching on a weekly basis at `Lycée Lakanal (at Sceaux, near Paris) <http://www2.lyc-lakanal-sceaux.ac-versailles.fr/>`_ in a `preparatory class <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles>`_ `(MP) <http://prepas.org/ups.php?article=56>`_, as:

- an examinator for regular oral exams in Mathematics (2 hours a week). My references for `the course content <http://mp.cpgedupuydelome.fr/courspe.php>`_ and `the tutorial problems <http://mp.cpgedupuydelome.fr/exospe.php>`_ are these (*French*) websites: `mp.cpgedupuydelome.fr <http://mp.cpgedupuydelome.fr>`_ (mainly), these exercises `by Nicolas Martin <http://nicolas.martin.ens.free.fr/orauxblancs.htm>`_ and `by Loïc Devilliers <http://loic.devilliers.free.fr/colles/colles.html>`_, and `"Le Frido" <http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~lclaesse/lefrido.pdf>`_, and this `True/False by Roger Mansuy <http://www.rogermansuy.fr/VF/index.html>`_ (and `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics>`_, of course).
- and as a Teaching Assistant for `the common Computer Science course <http://informatique-en-prepas.fr/>`_ (`based on this cool book <http://www.eyrolles.com/Sciences/Livre/informatique-pour-tous-en-classes-preparatoires-aux-grandes-ecoles-9782212137002>`_), with `Python 3k <learn-python.en.html>`_ and the `open-source Pyzo environnement <http://www.pyzo.org/>`_ (2 hours every 2 weeks). My references for the course content and the tutorial problems are `Python's documentation <https://doc.python.org/3/>`_, `introtopython.org <http://introtopython.org/>`_ and `these problems written by Jill-Jênn Vie <http://jill-jenn.net/tp/>`_.

.. seealso:: Complete solutions for the *Computer Science* course:

   Hey, you can have a look to my solutions: to `some algorithmic problems (written) <infoMP/TDs/solutions/>`_, to `some written exams about algorithms and data structures <infoMP/DSs/solutions/>`_,
   and to `some programming problems (implementation, on a computer, during a practical session) <infoMP/TPs/solutions/>`_.
   I was doing my best to provide full solutions for every week, and keep them up-to-date. Feel free to explore them!

.. note:: Replacement in BCPST-2A (2nd year biology prep'school)

   Between November 2015 and February 2016, I also gave one weekly hour of oral exam (in maths) for a class of `BCPST 2 <http://prepas.org/ups.php?article=43>`_ prep school.

:Total: For the scholar year 2015-16, I evaluate my teaching load to be **about 106 hours** (number of hours teaching to a group of students, or in charge of a practical session or an oral exam).

First semester of 2015 (in India)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `CS101 @ MEC <./cs101/>`_: in charge of the CS labs (practical sessions) and in charge of certain lectures!
  It was about 4 hours a week of CS labs, during 17 weeks, and 4 hours a week of lectures for 5 weeks (lectures were in an amphitheater of 115 students!).
  The slides for some of my lectures are here:

   1. *"About data-structures in Python (lists, sets, dictionaries)"*: `slides_CS101_part3.pdf <./publis/slides_CS101_part3.pdf>`_,
   2. *"Then, about the use of files in Python (open, read from and write to a file)"*: `slides_CS101_part5_1.pdf <./publis/slides_CS101_part5_1.pdf>`_,
   3. *"And finally an introduction to scientific plotting in Python with MatPlotLib"*: `slides_CS101_part5_2. <./publis/slides_CS101_part5_2.pdf>`_.

  More ressources are available:

   - `Exams (CS101) <./cs101/Exams/>`_: exam papers and complete solutions,
   - `Labs (CS101) <./cs101/labs/>`_: assignments and complete solutions for the practical sessions (labs),
   - `Solutions (CS101) <./cs101/solutions/>`_: solutions to various website or books about learning Python.

  :Projects: In April 2015, we gave to our students a programing project, and my teams had two projects: one about matrices and linear algebra operations (→ `mec-cs101-matrices.rtfd.io <https://mec-cs101-matrices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matrix.html>`_) and one about numerical integration techniques (→ `mec-cs101-integrals.rtfd.io <https://mec-cs101-integrals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrals.html>`_). I wrote the complete solutions for these two projects, in Python, and they are hosted on `ReadTheDocs.org <https://www.readthedocs.org>`_.

  :Examples: This `new git repository <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/python-demos/commits/>`_ (`python-demos <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/python-demos/>`_) now hosts about 60 examples of Python programs, involving various domains (such as image processing, scientific plotting, numerical or symbolical calculus, machine learning, linear algebra etc). These examples were and are here to illustrate what I covered during my lectures, in March and April 2015.

  :Hackhathon: For `Pi day <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day>`_ 2015 (3.14.15), I organized a huge hackhathon about *pi* (the number, but also *pie charts*). The written exam paper for the hackhathon is `available here (publis/hackhathon) <./publis/hackathon/14_03_2015.pdf>`_. About 50 students worked on it and had fun together on that day!

- `MA102 @ MEC <./ma102/>`_: in charge of one group for Maths tutorials (linear algebra and multi-variable calculus).

  More ressources are available:

   - `Exams (MA102) <./ma102/Exams/>`_: exam papers and complete solutions,
   - `Assignments (MA102) <./ma102/exos/>`_: assignments and some solutions for the practical sessions (tutorial),
   - `Techniques (MA102) <./ma102/techniques/>`_: some small documents summing up useful techniques of computations and proofs,
   - `Quiz (MA102) <./ma102/quiz/>`_: small quiz exam papers and solutions.

- I am also at the origin of an initiative to help our MEC students by giving them `lists of things to read or work on during the 2015 summer <https://mec-summer-15.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (*work in progress*).

:Total 2: For the first semester of 2015, I evaluate my teaching load to be **about 140 hours** (number of hours teaching in front of a group or an amphitheater of students).

In 2014
-------

Second semester of 2014 (in India)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `MA101 @ MEC <./ma101/>`_ (July - December 2014). In charge of 3 groups (out of 8) for Maths tutorials (introduction to calculus and logical thinking). 6 hours weekly, during 17 weeks (~ 102 hours).

  More ressources are available:

   - `Exams (MA101) <./ma101/Exams/>`_: exam papers and complete solutions,
   - `Assignments (MA101) <./ma101/exos/>`_: assignments and some solutions for the practical sessions (tutorial),
   - `Techniques (MA101) <./ma101/techniques/>`_: some small documents summing up useful techniques of computations and proofs,
   - `Quiz (MA101) <./ma101/quiz/>`_: small quiz exam papers and solutions.

:Total 1: For the second semester of 2014, I evaluated my teaching load to be **about 110 hours** (number of hours teaching in front of a group or an amphitheater of students).

:Examens: During the whole year, I was also in charge of the exam papers for Maths and CS: conceive them, merge the ideas from the colleagues, then write everything (in :math:`\LaTeX2e{}` of course), and write a complete and detailed solution, grade myself some of the papers and also overlook the grading done by my colleagues... With a total number of 9 exams (3 for MA101, 3 for CS101, 3 for MA102: *1st* and *2nd* *Mid-Term,* and *Final*), and about a dozen of quiz papers and lab exams, I became quite skilled at this kind of things.


First semester of 2014 (in France)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Regularly grading exam answer scripts @ `corrections-rue-ulm <http://www.ulm-corrections.fr/>`_ (exam answer scripts of high-school students, in mathematics).
- Occasionally helping high-school students and in charge of oral exams (at the level of Baccalauréat), with the `"Cours Thalès" organization <http://www.cours-thales.fr/>`_.

.. note::

   In 2014, I also got admitted to the French national competitive exam for becoming a prep' school professor (*"agrégation"*) in mathematics (with a major in maths, minor in CS).

   `Here are a lot of ressources for preparing the exam <agreg-2014/>`_ (in French).

   For the two scholar years 2014-15 and 2015-16, I asked to postpone the beginning of my carrier as a professor in the French secondary education, in order to properly conclude my training at `École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS of Cachan) <http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/>`_ (thanks to the choice *"fin de scolarité normalienne"*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Between 2009 and 2013
---------------------
  Nothing serious, but I used to regularly help my friends for Chemistry, Engineering, Physics (2009-2011), and Maths and Computer Science of course (2009-2014).

Before 2009 (high-school and before)
------------------------------------
  I used to regularly help my friends for Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Physics... but also *theater*.
