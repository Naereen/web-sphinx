 About hitch-hiking

.. include:: .special.rst

This page is a short presentation of my personal experience
on the matter of hitch-hiking, and why it is a really cool, free and culturally interesting way to travel.

Maybe I will include here a list of epic hitch-hiking achievements, maybe not.

As far as now, I added here a list of some of the nicest trips and travel steps I did by hitch-hiking, with an approximative sum-up of the distance drove by hitch-hiking.

A quick overview
----------------
  An *approximative* computation gives 2200 + 150 + 1800 + 350 = **4500 kms as far as now**.

In 2015 : **2200 kms**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About **2200 kms**, mainly in France, but also in Switzerland and in Iceland!

In August 2015, I visited Iceland mainly by hitch-hiking, and I hitch-hiked about **600 kms**, during 2 weeks:

.. digraph:: aug15island

   "Keflavik (airport)" -> "Gardur" -> "Grindavik" -> "Selfoss (1)";
   "Hopn (in the East)" -> "Jokurlsarlon" -> "Skaftafell" -> "Klaustur" -> "Vik (South)" -> "Skogar" -> "Landeyahopn (arrival)";
   "Landeyahopn (departure)" -> "Selfoss (2)" -> "Geysir" -> "Laugarvatn" -> "Thingvellir" -> "Reykjavik";


In July 2015, I went from Briançon to Avignon and the way back (in the PACA region), which is about 260 kms, twice, so **520 kms**.
And a few times between Briançon and Gap also helped me to hitch-hiked about **300 kms**, between May and August.

In June 2015, I hitch-hiked about 700 kms while I was traveling in France and Switzerland, for 10 days:

.. digraph:: voyage

   "Briançon (France)" -> "Gap" -> "Grenoble" -> "Chambéry" -> "Annecy" -> "Lausanne (Switzerland)" -> "Zurich (Switzerland)" -> "Bâle (Switzerland)" -> "Mulhouse (France)";


In 2014 : **150 kms**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About 150 kms, half a dozen of times, around Paris, and a *very little bit* near Hyderabad, in India.

In 2013 : **1800 kms**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Something like 1800 kms (for American *ignorants*, go `check on Wikipédia what kilometers are <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometers>`_), and only in France, in the "Landes" and "Normandie" regions.

In October 2013, I took a few days off, for a short trip in Normandie and in Bretagne, hitch-hiking about 600 kms:

.. digraph:: october13

   "Caen (France)" -> "Nantes" -> "Vannes" -> "Lorient" -> "Le Mans" -> "Paris";

In august 2013, after `the festival Berlioz <http://www.festivalberlioz.com/>`_, I came back to Paris in one afternoon, for about 500 kms:

.. digraph:: aug13

   "La-Côte-St-André (France)" -> "Grenoble" -> "Bourgouin-Jallieu" -> "Lyon" -> "Dijon" -> "Paris";

In May 2013, after a short stay in Spain, I came back to Paris from Pau (in the South-West part of France), for about environ 700 kms:

.. digraph:: may13

   "Pau (France)" -> "La Rochelle" -> "Paris";

In 2012
^^^^^^^
Less than 300 kms, mainly in *Corsica* and the *Côte-d'Azur*.

Before 2012
^^^^^^^^^^^
A very little bit, well I was not 18 at the time...

.. note:: With Google Maps ?

   I know that Google Maps can be used to save and share custom car *itineraries* (travel history),
   maybe I will use that to keep a trace of my hitch-hiking trips and
   share them here. Or maybe not.

(External) Hitch-Hiking guide to...
-----------------------------------
Some Hitch-Hiking guide to the Hitch-Hiker (of the road, not H2G2) !

If hitch-hiking seems interesting for you, I recommend these web-pages:

  - `The hitch-hiking guide on the WikiTravel.org project <http://wikitravel.org/en/Hitchhiking>`_, and `some specific advises for Europe <http://wikitravel.org/fr/Auto-stop_en_Europe>`_

Some websites are specialized about hitch-hiking:

  - `HitchWiki.org/en/ <http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page>`_ is a Wiki project only designed to provide help about hitch-hiking!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some informal statistics
------------------------
A few remarks about the nice drivers who are willing to take hitch-hikers :

* more men than women,
* alone people more than people with children,
* usually, they also practice hitch-hiking on their own, or they have practiced it before,
* not really able to notice any pattern in their age,
* usually they are locals (living near the start point or the destination).
