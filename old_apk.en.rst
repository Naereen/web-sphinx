 My favorite Android™ apps !
#############################

.. note:: This page is about Android™ apps

   For more details, maybe you should first read one of these:

    * for instance on `Android™ on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>`_,
    * or on `www.Android.com <https://www.Android.com>`_.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some lists of applications
--------------------------
 There are a few lists of some useful apps, kinda sorted by category.

.. note:: What is an application?

   An application (*app*) is a program for a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone powered by the **Android™** OS.

   These programs are distributed as compressed archives,
   with the ``apk`` format, which means "*Application PacKage*",
   as the *EXEcutable* program for **Windows™** with the ``.exe`` format,
   or the *Disk iMaGe* for **Mac OS X™** with the ``.dmg`` format.

.. warning:: Might be out-of-date!

   This list was written in *June and July 2014*, so now it might be a little bit out-of-date…
   I checked it in *July 2017*, and it was alright.
   However, I am not using all these apps anymore (my phone in 2017 has way less memory than the one I used in 2013 !).

.. note:: « What about iPhones™? » or « What about Windows™ phones? »

   I have not yet got the chance to own and use on a daily basis a phone using either one of these mobile OS,
   opponents of Android™ on the market (and this is not a reason of faith or ideology or whatever, just a coincidence).

   However, it should be easy for you to look for in the `Apple™ "App Store"™ <https://www.apple.com/fr/iphone-5s/app-store/>`_ or the `Windows™ "Application Store" <http://www.windowsphone.fr/fr-FR/store>`_ to find apps similar to the one presented here.

How to use Android™ **without** a Google™ account ?
---------------------------------------------------
Other repos
^^^^^^^^^^^
Among many apps repositories, my favorite is `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org/about/>`_,
mainly because it's completely free and focused only on Open Source apps.

For instance, there is `the page for AFWall+ <https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=firewall&fdid=dev.ukanth.ufirewall>`_, the best `firewall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_firewall>`_ on Android™.

.. seealso::

   `Aptoide <http://www.aptoide.com/>`_
      It is another good alternative to Google™ Play, like `F-Droid`_.

Direct download
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`apk-dl.com <http://apk-dl.com/>`_ is a wonderful website,
designed to simply download apps from the `official Google™ Play repository <https://play.google.com/store/apps/>`_
without having to log in with a Google™ account.

For instance, there is `a direct link for Jota Text Editor <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.sblo.pandora.jota>`_
(one of the best text editors on Android™, for which I designed the `syntactic coloration <NanoSyntax.html#autres-references>`_ configuration files for ``OCaml`` and ``rST`` !).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Old version
^^^^^^^^^^^
  `The first version of that page <https://wiki.crans.org/VieCrans/ApplicationsAndroid>`_ was in French, on the `Wiki <https://wiki.crans.org/>`_ of the `CRANS <https://crans.org/>`_ association.
